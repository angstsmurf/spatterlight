INSTALL file for libtimidity
============================

In most systems just run:
 $ ./configure
 $ make

You need GNU make.  On BSD or SysV systems, you may need to use gmake
instead of make.  Use ./configure --help to see configuration options.
Hint:  You may want to use --with-timidty-cfg=/path/to/timidity.cfg .
To install the library and development components, run "make install"
as the superuser.  This will install the shared and static libraries,
header file and pkg-config file into directories under /usr/local or a
different location selected with the --prefix option in configure.

To cross-compile, you will need to use the --host option of configury.
For example:
$ ./configure --host=powerpc-apple-darwin9    # for Mac OS X (powerpc)
$ ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32          # for Windows (win32)
$ ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32       # for Windows (win64)

For Mac OS X, we provide an XCode project file for your convinence.

For Windows, we provide a Visual Studio project file (for VS2005 or
newer) for your convinence.

We also provide standalone makefiles for Windows, Mac OS X (Darwin),
DOS (DJGPP), OS/2, as well as MorphOS, AmigaOS and AROS.
