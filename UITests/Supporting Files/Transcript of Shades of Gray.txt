WASHINGTON, May 2 --

As you walk down the path, you glimpse a half-remembered face reflected in a window.

You turn

         but there is no one there.

You are on the sidewalk outside some anonymous office building.  The stones are glistening from the rain that has fallen on them.  Apart from that, it looks just like any other sidewalk.  The sidewalk continues to the north and south, and there is a storm drain in the gutter to the east.

You are at a bend in a dark alleyway piled high with empty packing cases and crates.  Exits from the alley are to the south and the east.

You wonder if you've killed him.  But after a few moments, he comes to, moans and runs away.  He seems to have left something behind, however.

You are in an empty warehouse, derelict and deserted.  Something about this place makes you very uneasy.  You're sure you should have memories about a deserted warehouse, but you can't recall them.

> fix bucket
You wonder if the liquid still in the vial will mend the leaky bucket. You try it.  To your amazement, you find that it congeals over the holes.

The vial is obviously magical -- unless are you simply dreaming.  You put the bucket back in the vial since it seems to be happier in there.

The well winks at you flirtatiously.

You tie the bucket to the rope and lower it down the well.  You swing it about until you manage to scoop up the key.  Then you haul it back to the surface.  You take the key out and put the bucket back in the vial.

Your mother seems to have forgotten you in her sorrow, and you can't forgive yourself for having caused your father's death.  Everything around you seems dismal.  Those present are all in black, and it is raining.  You start to cry as the coffin is lowered into the ground.

Finally, the burial is over.  Your mother turns to speak to you.  "If you want to stay here for a few more minutes, to say goodbye to your father, I'll be waiting down at the cemetery gates."

You are left all alone at the graveside.

Slaves name Spartacus as their leader.  He is due to have discussions with local Roman military leaders.  The Roman Senate declared that there can be no discussion with mere slaves, and ordered the legions to suppress the uprising ruthlessly.

Daedalus invents wings -- man can now reach for the skies.  His son, Icarus, claimed that his father's invention was inferior to his own wings (due to be unveiled next year), which will be capable of flying him to the sun and back.

Despite the threats made against his life by militant dock workers, King George of Britain is due to visit the port of Boston, in the Massachusetts Colony, in December 1773.  The local military garrison are taking the threats seriously.

The Senate is threatening to halt President Wilson's shipments of arms and food to besieged Britain.  The potential loss of American lives is considered too serious, despite the fact that many think Lend-Lease is the only hope for Europe's survival against the Germans.

"Magdalena is at home, but she does not admit psychopaths or fools.  I must ask you a few simple questions to make sure you are worthy of her time."

 WHAT CITY ARE YOU IN?

washington

 WHAT MONTH IS IT NOW?

october

 WHAT YEAR IS IT NOW?

1957

 WHAT IS YOUR FIRST NAME?

austin

 WHAT IS YOUR SURNAME?

garriot
As you answer the final question, the door swings open to the east...

You are in a cluttered storefront that reeks of frankincense.  The furniture consists of two folding metal chairs and a desk piled high with books, papers charts, candles, massage oils, incense sticks, decks of cards, crystal balls and other divinatory paraphernalia.  Sitting on the more comfortable chair is a plump middle-aged lady swathed in silver jewelry and voluminous silk scarves. She waves at you from across the room.

"Come in, come in --  oy, you look terrible!"  She motions for you to take a seat on a metal folding chair, then reaches across her cluttered desk to squeeze your arm.

"So -- you are Austin Garriot.  You're wondering how I knew that?  Ha! It's a simple thing when you have The Gift, like I do.  You come here to my office, I have a vision.  The spirits whisper in my ear, 'Magdalena, this is Austin Garriot.  He has a problem.  Only you can help him.'"  The plump gypsy lady smiles at you expectantly.

> talk to lady.
You explain to Magdalena that you have lost your memory, and describe the harrowing and bizarre experiences of your last few hours.  You expect her to throw you out of the office, or call the police to have you carted away to an asylum, but Magdalena nods sympathetically.

"Terrible, just terrible.  You're a golem.  You've lost your soul."

> ask lady about soul.
Magdalena digs a book out from under the pile on her desk, and blows the dust off of it.  She reads for a moment or two, then looks up at you cheerfully. "So, there's some good news and some bad news.  Bad news first.  To give a golem back his soul, you have to finish writing his name on his forehead. But you don't have anything written there, so whoever stole your soul must have done it some other way.  Do we know what that is?  No."

She scratches your forehead with a fingernail, as if to make completely sure. Then she sighs, and continues.  "OK, now the good news.  I have my own way to get back your soul."  She sits back in her chair, waiting to see what effect her words will have on you.  Then, she continues.

"Just for you, on special, I'm offering kabbalistic gypsy Tarot Card readings, guaranteed to get your soul back in your body.  We'll say, only for today -- twenty dollars even."

> ask lady about charm.
Magdalena smiles. "Silver is a good thing. Silver is a catalyst for the Gift."

> ask lady about gift.
Magdalena smiles.  "What a nice boy you are to ask about me.  My mother was a gypsy -- because of her, I'm named Magdalena.  My father was a Jew -- because of him, I'm named Rosenstein.  I inherited The Gift from my mother and this shop from my father, may they rest in peace.  How could I disappoint them by squandering my inheritance?  So here I am."  She admires her office with satisfaction.

> ask lady about golem.
"Just for you, on special, I'm offering kabbalistic gypsy Tarot Card readings, guaranteed to get your soul back in your body.  We'll say, only for today -- twenty dollars even."

> ask lady about tarot.
Magdalena adjusts her scarves and smiles.  "Yes, yes, didn't I say I would give you a reading?  But for the spell to work properly, for your soul to find its way back into your body, you must cross my palm with silver."

> give charm to lady.
Magdalena takes the charm from you with a smile.  She admires it for a moment before it joins the rest of the ornamentation gracing her neck and arms. "Such a nice boy.  Are you married?  No, of course you're not, or else why would you be here?"  She pats you on the arm sympathetically.

"Here's a deck of cards.  Shuffle it now, shuffle it and think of love."

> x deck.
[x -> examine]
The Tarot deck that Magdalena is using consists of only the Major Arcana.

> think of love
As you think about love, the scent of orchids rises in the air around you.

> shuffle deck
You shuffle the Tarot deck and think about the woman whose picture you have in your wallet.  Hilary?  Yes, that's her name.  You can't remember anything about who she is or how you know her, but you feel comforted just by the sound of her name.  When you are finished shuffling, you hand the deck back to Magdalena.

She clears off a space on her desk with a sweep of her arm, and lays out eleven cards face up in front of you.  She peers down at them, and after a few moments, nods with satisfaction.  "Didn't I say so?  Don't I always know?"

> x hermit. ask lady about hermit.
[x -> examine]
This card bears an image of a cloaked man with a lantern and a staff.

"The first card represents your Real Self.  The Hermit!  Is that who you really are?  Such a wise and good man?  It's hard to tell from looking at you."  She sniffs the air critically.  "You do smell like a hermit. Maybe that's what it means."

> x fool. ask lady about fool.
[x -> examine]
This card bears an image of a young man about to walk off the edge of a cliff.  A small dog nips at his heel.

"The second card Cloaks you.  It represents who you appear to be.  The Hermit is covered by the Fool."  Magdalena laughs.  "Did you know you have schmutz all over your face?  What have you been doing, lying in the gutter?"

> x moon. ask lady about moon.
[x -> examine]
This card bears the image of dogs howling at a full moon.

"The third card is what Crosses you.  Don't tell me -- you've been howling at the Moon, lately, haven't you?"  She nods smugly.  "I can always tell."

> x devil. ask lady about devil.
[x -> examine]
This card bears an image of the devil holding a man and woman in chains.

"The fourth card is Behind you."  Magdalena turns a little pale and looks at you with some respect.  "Sometime in your past, you have looked the Devil in the face."

> x lovers. ask lady about lovers.
[x -> examine]
This card bears an image of a man and woman standing beneath a heavenly sky.

"The fifth card is In Front of you.  Here is your future.  What can come to pass."  She winks at you slyly.  "The Lovers.  Should I have to explain?"

> x tower. ask lady about tower.
[x -> examine]
This card bears an image of a burning tower, struck by lightning and storm.

"The sixth card Carries you.  It underlies everything.  But, see, the Tower is burning.  Oy."  She shakes her head.  "Oy."

> x judgment. ask lady about judgment.
[x -> examine]
This card bears an image of an angel blowing a trumpet at people waiting below.

"The seventh card Crowns you.  This is your destiny, the reason, the meaning. What could the Judgment card mean here?"  Magdalena throws her hands up in the air.  "Don't ask me."

> x world. ask lady about world.
[x -> examine]
This card bears an image of a wreath with a woman within, and animals without.

The eighth card represents your Self.  Ah, the World is here.  That means you know your way around."  She raises an eyebrow.  "You could be a good catch, after all.  I have a niece, such a nice girl.  You would like her."

> x justice. ask lady about justice.
[x -> examine]
This card bears an image of a seated man holding a sword and a scale.

"The ninth card represents your House, your influence on the world."  She ponders this for a moment.  "Justice is a good card.  You come from a good family, maybe.  Thank God your mother can't see you like this."

> x magician. ask lady about magician.
[x -> examine]
This card bears an image of an alchemist casting a spell.

"The tenth card is your Vision.  You haven't had it yet, so who can say what it will be.  The Magician will help you."  She pinches your cheek affectionately.  "So, don't you worry."

> x wheel. ask lady about wheel.
[x -> examine]
This card bears an image of a wheel suspended in the heavens.

"The final card is the Outcome of it all.  The Wheel of Fortune."  Magdalena begins to laugh, first in tiny chuckles and then in loud guffaws.  When she is calm enough, she wipes a teary eye with the end of a scarf.  "Sorry, sorry, I shouldn't lose control like that.  It's bad for business."

> ask lady about cards
Magdalena puts her hand on your arm.  "Enough talking.  To find your soul, you're going to have to go looking."  Magdalena gets comfortable on her chair. "Austin, I want you to take a deep breath.  Then, whenever you're ready, concentrate on one of the cards."

> concentrate on hermit.
As you concentrate on the Hermit card, your eyes close, and you feel yourself descending into mist for a long, blissful moment. "Seventeen... sixteen... relax and let go... fifteen... fourteen... you're falling, thirteen, twelve....

Somewhere in the back of your mind, you can hear Magdalena's voice speaking to you softly: "If you are not as crazy as you appear to be, who are you really, Austin?"

The voice fades as the world takes shape and form again.

You are at home in your study, in the thick of serious research.  Your papers and notes and books and documents are spread out around you, taking up a whole table length.  You look at your watch.  Damn.  You're supposed to be meeting some friends after dinner.  If you skip dinner, you could probably get there without being offensively late.

You hesitate, unsure about whether to stop working or stand up your friends. You don't have to think about it for long.  They'll just have to understand. You decide to do the responsible thing, but deep inside you, you don't feel that you've made any kind of sacrifice at all.  You just feel... happy.

In the back of your mind, you can hear a woman's soft counting: "Seven... eight... nine... coming up, coming back... ten... eleven... twelve."

As you come back to yourself, you hear Magdalena's voice: "So," she says with satisfaction, "now we know you like to read."  She snaps her fingers. "Come back to this world now, Austin. Open your eyes.  Look around you."

As you concentrate on the Fool card, your eyes close, and you feel yourself descending into mist for a long, blissful moment. "Seventeen... sixteen... relax and let go... fifteen... fourteen... you're falling, thirteen, twelve....

You are walking down a crowded street in Washington, D.C.  You're trying, like everyone else, to be casual about the suffering of the homeless and the mentally ill, to ignore the inappropriate requests and ravings that go on around you.  But every once in a while, it's difficult not to hear...

You pass a phone booth.  In the booth, a man stands with his back to you.  He is talking to himself.  For some reason, you are curious enough to listen to the struggle.  The man is having an argument over the phone book.

"You say I can't read this book because I am damned?" he roars.  He waves a tattered newspaper clipping under an invisible nose, then quotes from it:

The possessor was found guilty of the heresy of believing that the Earth is not the center of the Universe, and of failing to recant his sin.  He is not to be accepted into the precincts of any establishment of the faith, nor to be given the grace of any --

The man turns around, and you realize, with agonizing shame, who he is...

In the back of your mind, you can hear a woman's soft counting: "Seven... eight... nine... coming up, coming back... ten... eleven... twelve."

She snaps her fingers. "Come back to this world now, Austin. Open your eyes. Look around you."

You find yourself facing a judge in a courtroom, but it doesn't seem like an ordinary trial.  There are no defense or prosecution lawyers.  The room is filled to capacity with press and photographers, but all you notice is the panel of grim-faced men sitting behind a high bench in front of you.

Everything blurs to insignificance as the judge glares down at you.  You hear his words thundering in your mind:

"Are you, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist party?"

You shake your head.

Senator McCarthy doesn't seem convinced.  "Didn't you attend several Communist party meetings in the summer of 1945?"

You reply that you ONCE attended a meeting, because of your studies.  But you found it uninteresting, and never went to another.

Senator McCarthy stares you into the ground.  "I want to know the Communists you know.  I want their names now."

You cite your constitutional rights.

He smiles at you unpleasantly.  "You leave me with little doubt that you are still a member of the Communist party.  I'll do everything in my power to see that you are no longer permitted to influence young minds with your anti-American filth.  This is your last chance.  Give me a name."

You remain silent.

"You are cited for contempt of Congress."  McCarthy pounds his gavel and waves toward you in disgust.  "Get him out of here."

You are in a field overlooking a large valley.  The field is surrounded by a thick forest.  Debris thrown up by hours of shelling litters the ground. There is very little breeze, and the blue sky is obscured by smoke that billows from someplace nearby.  The only sounds you can hear are the echoes of guns firing and shells exploding.

There are a few large rocks in the area. A veteran soldier is working beside you.

> x rocks. x soldier.
[x -> examine]
The rocks are formed from the solid matter of the earth's crust.  These particular rocks look to be from the feldspar family, though you note a bit of quartz here and there.

The veteran soldier is hard at work preparing a crude barricade to hide behind.  He ignores you completely.

You're carrying:
   empty rifle
   canvas knapsack
You're wearing:

   small shovel
   shiny bullets

The gun is now loaded.

[x -> examine]
You feel a bullet pass right by your left ear.

You keep this watch for sentimental reasons.  It hasn't worked for over a year, but it was a gift from your now-departed grandfather.  It is eternally stuck at 11:59.

> take shovel. dig ground.
You take the spade out of the knapsack.

The din swells to a tremendous chorus.  It's like the roar of an oncoming train.  The billowing smoke creeps into your nostrils.  You realize that death is imminent unless you find some cover.

You quickly dig a hole that is large enough for you to enter.  The dirt is piled in front of the hole.

> move rocks.
A shell comes screaming over your head.  It explodes and flings the brown earth all over you.  Bullets whistle among the branches.  Twigs and branches shower you from above.

You move the rocks in such a way as to create a crude barricade.

> enter hole.
The din swells to a tremendous chorus.  It's like the roar of an oncoming train.  The billowing smoke creeps into your nostrils.  You realize that death is imminent unless you find some cover.

You jump in the shallow hole, protected by the barricade.

You are behind a crude barricade fabricated from rocks and dirt.  Looking over the barricade, you see a field surrounded by a thick forest.  Piles of dirt and rocks thrown up by hours of shelling litter the ground.  There is very little breeze, and the blue sky is obscured by smoke that billows from someplace nearby.  The only sounds you can hear are the echoes of guns firing and shells exploding.

All of a sudden, the sound of screaming penetrates the woods.  It combines with the sounds of gunfire, making a profound clamor.  You see the lines of troops tumbling one by one.

From your vantage point, you can see desperate men rushing back and forth, yelling and screaming like maniacs.

A brown mass emerges from the darkness and grows in size.  It becomes apparent that the whole command is fleeing.  When the young soldier sees this, he climbs out of the hole and runs off in the direction of the retreating men.  You quickly lose sight of him in the clouds of smoke.

Next across the smoke-infested fields comes a blue swarm of running men. Their yells fill the air.  They come on, swinging their rifles at all angles. You want to run, but you see the veteran soldier holding his position and firing at the approaching troops.

Adrenalin fills your body when you realize you are about to come face to face with the enemy.  Your hands are shaking and your throat is dry. You forget whatever it was you were going to do, because your dreams of glory and fame are about to be realized...

and you are scared to death.

From your vantage point, you can see desperate men rushing back and forth, yelling and screaming like maniacs.

You stick your head above the rocks to get a better view, and are startled by a Union soldier who seems to be as startled as you are.  A long moment passes, and time slows nearly to a crawl.  Then, suddenly, the soldier leaps over the barricade and lands next to you, weapon in hand.  He raises his gun and points it at you, finger poised on the trigger.

You tap your foot nervously for a moment.  It doesn't seem to make the time go any faster.

> shoot soldier
You pull the trigger of your rifle, and it explodes in a ball of fire and fury that knocks the Union soldier to the ground.  You feel his warm blood splatter on your skin.  Clutching his face, the soldier screams until his voice is lost in coughs and sputtering.  You stare in horror as he convulses on the ground.

You turn away from the dying soldier and survey the continuing battle.  You feel queasy and lightheaded.  Something hits you in the back of the neck. You hear screams, gunfire, explosions -- and then silence.

You are on a path surrounded by dead trees.  At your feet are the motionless, ghastly forms of your comrades.  They barely look human.  Arms are twisted and necks bent in ways God never intended.  The rain continues to fall. The path continues to the north and south.

The rain must have fallen harder in this area, because the ground has turned to mud.  The trees are stripped of their leaves, and nothing is growing as far as the eye can see.

   A dead soldier is propped up against a tree.

> x soldier. x bulge
[x -> examine]
The dead soldier's arms are extended out from his sides.  His eyes stare off into the heavens.  He must have been shot in the cheek -- the supports are gone and his jaw hangs down, displaying a mass of blood and teeth.  His face is locked in an eternal scream.

In spite of the horror, there is a look of peace in the dead soldier's eyes. He almost seems glad to be through with the madness.

The sun has faded the soldier's uniform to a dull grey.  The fabric is worn and tattered.  Upon closer examination, you see a bulge in his coat pocket.

You search the dead body's pockets and find a timepiece.  It has a bullet through its face, and is covered in blood.  When you wipe the dried blood off, you notice that, like your own watch, it seems to be stopped at 11:59.

As you reach down to put the watch back into the soldier's pocket, his dead eyes suddenly open and fixate on you.  In horror, you try to jump away, but he grabs you with a bloody arm.  His voice is plaintive.  "Why did you do it?"

You protest:  "I was just a child.  I didn't mean to kill him.  It was an accident."  But the soldier ignores your words.  He pulls a large knife out of his coat, and thrusts it into your chest.

You are in your makeshift living quarters.  It is a cheap canvas tent that does little to keep out the elements.  In fact, a large hole in the ceiling allows you a clear view of the sky.  There is a flap to the north.

The colonel is in the middle of a speech to the troops.

"We must charge them!  You hear me?  We must charge them, goddamit!  I don't wanna see none of you yella bellies turnin' tail and runnin' away.  You hear me?  Now here's my plan for tomorrah."  He stops speaking as you walk up. His eyes focus on you.

This is a makeshift main camp.  There is a large campfire in the center of the area, and empty crates that serve duty as seats.  There is a heavy wooden box lying near the fire.

   Colonel Snopes appears to be waiting for something.

> salute
You salute the colonel.  He returns the salute.

> wait
The colonel stares at you.

"Well, lookee here.  What's wrong with you, soldier?  You think you're better than the rest of the troops here?  That you can come to these meetin's when you feel like it?  Huh, soldier?"  He points to you. "This soldier thinks he is better than you.  Dammit, men, are you goin' to stand for this?"

The troops take time out from tending their wounds for a collective "No."

The colonel continues. "Goddamit, son, look at me when I'm talkin' to you. Now, you just keep quiet, you heah?  Not a peep, got it?"

He turns his attention to the rest of the troop.  "Now, what was I sayin'? Oh, yeah.  We gotta charge them damn Yankees, you heah me?  Remember, you're fightin' for the South.  You're fightin' for your momma.  You're fightin' for your daddy.  You're fightin' for your ancestahs."

"Tommorah, we're gonna go back to that ridge we were fightin' at today. Only this time, they'll be no sittin' back and waitin' for them to come to us.  That's for girls!  We's gonna go right for their throats!  Okay, I want Battalion 49 to approach from the south..."

You watch the colonel as he outlines his plan for attack.  You look over the broken bodies of your comrades, and then at the colonel's red face.  You don't hear the rest of the speech.  Your mind begins to wander to memories of your childhood -- spending the summers swimming in the local lake, running through fields of grass, playing with friends.  Those days seem so far away.

One of the soldiers next to you lets out a groan and awakens you from your daydream.  You turn and look at him, and he has a half-smile on his face. Blood streams from a gash in his right arm.  He looks in awe at the colonel, who is still serenading the troops about the glory and dignity of war.

The colonel ends his speech.  "Y'all go back to your tents.  I want you to be strong, proud Suthuners tommorah.  I want you to make your mommas proud. Remembah, you're doin' it for them.  You're doin' it for the South.  You're doin' it for youselves.  Now, give 'em hell tommorrah!"

The troops let out a loud cheer as the colonel walks away with his entourage. The men slowly disperse back to their tents to rest for the evening.

This storage tent contains various supplies.  You can exit to the west.

   A powder keg is stored here for safekeeping.
      There's an old rag here. (Inside keg hole)

> light rag with torch
You light the rag with the torch, and stand there for a moment as it burns. You decide not to wait around to see what happens next.  You run out of the tent, head north toward the main camp, and dive behind a berm made of dirt.

Nothing happens. No explosions.  No fireworks.  Nothing.

You scratch your head, and look over your inventory to see what else could be used as a fuse.

You stand up and look out into the black night.  As you take a step to the south -- BOOOOM -- you are thrown to the ground by the force of the exploding powder keg.  All the tents in the immediate vicintity are blown down. You drop everything you were carrying.

You get up, shake your head, and wipe the dirt off your clothes.

This is a makeshift main camp.  There is a large campfire in the center of the area, and empty crates that serve duty as seats.  There is a heavy wooden box lying near the fire.

   Your canvas knapsack is here.
      There are some bullets here. There are some new clothes neatly folded in a pile. There is an old crowbar here. A length of strong rope is coiled here. There is a burning torch here.

You stand on the bank of the Holston river.  The waters are low this year. There is some dry brush just off the shore.  A path begins here and leads back to the west.  Across the river to the east you can see nothing but darkness.

You are swimming in the cool, clear waters of the Holston river.  From here, you can see the bridge and the troops positioned on it.  The river continues to the east, and the shore is behind you to the west.

You are still swimming in the Holston river.  The water revives and refreshes you, and you feel cleansed by the cool, clear water.  From here, you can see the bridge and the troops positioned on it.  You are nearing the eastern bank of the river.  You can hear a train in the distance.

> e
You are standing on the bank of the Holston river, which lies to your west.  A path leads off into the forest to the east.  The train sounds much closer now.

> e
You follow a winding path through the forest.  It ends abruptly at some train tracks.  There is a slow-moving freight train here.

> enter train
Sweating and panting, you leap into a car on the slow-moving freight train. You peek out, and see a shadow slip into one of the cars behind yours.  Maybe your eyes are playing tricks on you.  You hear nothing but the train moving steadily toward the north.

You lie down in a corner of the car.  Before long, you drift off into a deep sleep.

[Press any key...]

You are rudely awakened by the sound of the train coming to a stop.  Your first thought is that you'll be discovered.  Fear wells up inside of you as you remember the punishment for desertion.

You hear voices in the distance.  They seem to be getting closer.

You are in a dank and musty boxcar.  It is empty except for the small pile of straw in one corner that served as your bed.

> remove uniform
You take off your smelly old uniform and cast it away with distaste.

You hear someone say, "Get the hell outta there, you goddam bum!"

You open the knapsack and have a look at what is inside.
   shiny bullets
   new clothes

You put on the clothes.

> put uniform in knapsack
You place the uniform in the knapsack.

> close knapsack
You have closed the knapsack.

> wait
The door to your car opens, and a group of sweaty, red-faced men confronts you.  The man in the front seems to be sweating even more then the others. He eyeballs you from head to toe.

"Get outta there, you goddam bum!  Goddam freeloadin' bum!"

He grabs you by the arm, pulls you out of the train, and throws you to the ground.  One of the men kicks dust in your eyes.  Another picks you up and punches you in the face.  You fall down onto the hard ground.

Everything goes black...

You hear leaves shuffling ahead of you.

You have come to the end of the road.  An eerie silence has fallen upon this area, as if every living thing had packed up its bags and left.  A road heads off to the west, and you can see a clearing in the forest to the south.

> s
You hear a noise from behind.  You turn and see a shadow move on the ground.

This field has obviously not been in use for some time.  The soil is hard and dry, and the only crops growing here are weeds.  There is an ominouslooking house to the east.

You are on the front porch of a run-down house.  Some junk is scattered on the porch, and the paint is peeling from the house.  Paths lead around the house to the north and south, and a field lies to the west. There is a door here.

You knock, and a boy answers the door.  He looks vaguely familiar, but you can't quite place the face.  He looks to be about eight years old, with dark hair and vibrant blue eyes.

As you start to ask for directions or help, he reaches out and touches you on the stomach.  "Tag, you're it," he says.  Before you can respond, he closes the door and locks it.

> s
You hear laughter up ahead.

You are on the south side of the house.  The paint here is worse than in the front, and the windowshades are all drawn.  The plants near the foundation of the house are all dead or dying.  There are curved paths to the east and west.

You insert the key in the lock and give the knob a turn.  The door groans as if it were in pain, and opens inward to the east.

You hear leaves shuffling ahead of you.

As you enter the room, the door slams shut and locks.  You turn quickly, but can see nothing behind you.

Something about this room looks familiar.  Maybe it's the antique furniture, the wooden floor, the floral drapes, or the large embroidered rug.  It is certainly not the boarded-up back door, or the large hole in the center of the room, is it?  But the room definitely reminds you of something.  Suddenly, you are filled with thoughts of home.  You can almost see your mother sitting in a chair, looking out of the window as she waits for your father to return. There is a staircase leading up.

While the room downstairs still looks somewhat civilized, this one does not. It appears that the ceiling caved in at some point, sending beams through the floor all the way to the basement.  One beam remains, hanging directly over the hole in the floor.  The hole is about ten feet across, and the floor near it doesn't look particularly stable.

   There is a small boy here, laughing at you.

> x boy
[x -> examine]
The boy looks remarkably like you did when you were young -- the same hair, the same body, the same voice.  At the moment, he is laughing at you and egging you on to jump across the hole.

He yells across the hole, "Chicken!  I got here.  Jump!  Jump!"

> tie rope to beam
You tie the rope to the beam.

> swing rope
Doing your best Tarzan impersonation, you fly across the hole.  As you do, you drop all of your possessions into the darkness.  This doesn't concern you much, since your mind is on other things.  As you swing precariously, the beam above you begins to split...

You land with a thud on the other side of the hole.  Just then, the beam gives way and crashes to the basement.  You check your footing.  The wood here seems solid enough.

The ceiling is completely gone above this part of the room.  You can see the grey, dead sky looking down at you ominously.  It casts a shadowy gloom over you.  There are no exits except for the hole that you just crossed.

   There is a small boy here, laughing at you.

> talk to boy
You begin to speak to the boy, but he interrupts you. "Daddy always told me that war was the best times for him.  He fought in the big war.  There were bad guys and there were good guys when I was little."

Little?  You chuckle to yourself when he says this.

"Only this war is different.  There's no cause here worth fighting for. We should have known better.  You should have known better."  He turns to face you. "Why didn't you know better?  Why didn't you say 'no' when they sent you to battle?"

His face turns hard and cold.  He begins to walk toward you.  "I feel sorry for people like you.  They go through life thinking they're doing the right thing by doing nothing at all.  They let horrible things go on and don't do a damn thing to stop them.  Not a damn thing!"

You back away from the boy as he continues to approach.  "Well, I've had enough of you.  Off you go..."

And with that, he pushes you into the hole.

[Press any key...]

Down, down, you fall, into an inky black void.  You fall for what seems like an eternity.  Images flash by in front of you so quickly that you are unable to grab hold of any of them.  You anticipate impact.

You awaken to find yourself on the battlefield.  A soldier is hovering above you.

"You OK, soldier?  You took a hit in the head.  You're gonna be OK."

You try to remember what happened.  You touch your head and you feel a bandage and a wet spot.  You look at your blurry hand and see a red smear. You look up at the grey, dead sky, wondering what will happen next.

Magdalena's voice is thoughtful. "You look like a man to me, but that angry boy was YOU.  He blames you, he blames himself." Even with your eyes closed you can see Magdalena shrug.  "Something bad happened to you when you were very small.  You don't have to tell me.  I know.  It still makes you afraid. It makes you want to see the world in black and white."

Magdalena snaps her fingers.  "Come back to this world now, Austin.  Open your eyes.  Look around you."

A dark-haired woman stands beside you.  You look at her uncertainly, and she reaches out to take your hand.  But there's nothing she can do to help you now.  It's your decision.  Your call.

You are in a clearing in Sherwood Forest.  A fire at the center of the clearing provides some comfort from the chill of an English midwinter day. There are stones, leaves, and broken twigs scattered around.

   Marion is preoccupied in thought.
   Nazir is polishing his immaculate weapons.

> x myself. i.
[x -> examine]
You are Robert of Locksley, more commonly known as Robin of the Hood, or just Robin Hood.  Son of a Saxon noble, you were driven from your ancestral home when the local Normans took a liking to it and murdered your father. You weren't there at the time, but on crusade with King Richard.  You returned to find yourself an outlaw.

Seeing how the Norman nobles oppressed the Saxon villages of the district, and guided by instructions from Herne, the forest god of the hunt, you took up residence in the Forest of Sherwood, and gathered around you a group of loyal followers.  Together, you pledged yourself to justice, in opposition to the Norman leaders of the district (led by the wicked Sheriff of Nottingham). Marion, your childhood sweetheart, has joined you; as has Will Scathelock, a distant cousin; and Nazir, a Saracen whose life you saved in Palestine, and who has vowed to stay with you.

Recently, the Normans raided the Saxon village of Newark, but you were able to drive them away.  Now, you have regrouped in the forest, and are awaiting the arrival of winter.

You are empty-handed.

> x Marion. x fire. x twigs. x Nazir.
[x -> examine]
Marion sits warming her hands by the fire, occasionally tossing small twigs onto the flames.  She meets your gaze and smiles.

The small fire consists entirely of twigs fallen from the bare winter trees.

There are a few dry twigs scattered across the ground, mixed in with the leaves and stones.

The fire is no longer burning so brightly now that most of the twigs have burned.  The air feels much chillier.

Nazir sits on a rock, polishing his wickedly curved scimitars.  He is a powerful, dark-skinned man, a Saracen.  He is reputed to be a deadly fighter.

> put twigs in fire.
The last twig has been consumed, leaving a few glowing embers.

You throw a handful of twigs onto the fire.  Immediately, the flames rage brightly again.

> talk to Nazir.
Will Scarlet emerges from the forest, followed by a young woman who is shivering violently from the cold.  "Robin, look what I found while hunting!" Scarlet warms himself by the fire, and you invite the woman to do the same.

Nazir ponders the wisdom in your words, but does not reply.

> talk to Marion.
The young woman shivers fearfully.

Marion chats with you affectionately for a while.

> x woman. talk to woman.
[x -> examine]
The young woman shivers fearfully.

The young woman is quite beautiful, with long, dark hair and perfectly formed features.  You feel a strange determination, almost an obligation, to help her any way you can.  As you watch her rocking back and forth, rubbing her hands together for warmth, you could almost swear the fire has begun to burn more brightly.

The young woman seems to be reviving in the warmth of the fire.

The young woman is too cold to speak to you right now.

> x Will.
[x -> examine]
The young woman seems to be reviving in the warmth of the fire.

The fire is no longer burning so brightly now that most of the twigs have burned.  The air feels much chillier.

Will Scarlet (aka Scathlock) is an aggressive man, never short of an opinion of his own.  He's a hit-em-first-ask-questions-later kind of guy.

> put twigs in fire.
The young woman seems to be reviving in the warmth of the fire.

The last twig has been consumed, leaving a few glowing embers.

You throw a handful of twigs onto the fire.  Immediately, the flames rage brightly again.

> talk to Will.
The woman has recovered enough to speak.  She looks at you across the flames. "Are you Robin of Sherwood?"  You nod, and she continues: "My name is Katherine of Newark.  I thank you for saving my life.  I would have died of the cold, had it not been for your fire."

Will smiles appreciatively at your insightful comment.

> talk to woman.
Katherine looks at you searchingly across the flames.  "As you well know, Newark, my home, was attacked by the Sheriff's men.  Your good people helped us to drive them away, but my mother, Elizabeth, was captured during the fray.  She has been taken to the castle by Sir Guy of Gisburne.  He wants a ransom for her release, but the ransom is not money."

Marion reaches out to take the other woman's hand.  "Katherine, I'm so sorry."

Katherine smiles sadly.  "Yes, you have guessed it.  He wants ME.  If I refuse him, my mother will be tortured and will die in a prison cell.  Can you help me, Robin?"  Katherine's eyes are focused on yours, entreating you to understand the depth of her need.

> x eyes.
[x -> examine]
As you look deeply into Katherine's eyes, the fire that lies between you flares so suddenly that Marion, Will, and Nazir step back hastily to avoid being burned.  Strangely, you don't feel the heat from the fire.  In fact, you don't feel anything at all.  Your eyes are focused on Katherine's, and you are drawn into their depths.

Where Katherine had been standing, you now see Herne the Hunter, god of woodlands and forests.  A voice booms inside your mind --  Herne's voice! "To help this woman, Robin, you must travel alone and weaponless -- you must persuade your friends to leave you.  They cannot help you now, for stealth and secrecy is the key."

As the vision fades and the fire retreats, the contact between you and Katherine is broken.  You find yourself being shaken by a very concerned Will Scarlet.

> tell Will about vision.
You describe to your friends the vision you have just seen.  Marion speaks for them all.  "Well, Robin.  I can't say I like the idea, but the message seems clear.  We'll go, but not too far.  We'll be here when you need us." Your friends embrace you and quickly disappear into the forest.

When you and Katherine are alone by the fire, Katherine smiles.  "Herne gave me a vision, as well.  I'm to lead you through the forest."  Katherine heads out of the clearing and beckons you to follow.

> follow Katherine.
You follow Katherine down winding paths and twisting trails.  You know that you are traveling towards Nottingham, but the path you are on is unfamiliar. After several hours, Katherine stops and directs you to the west.

"This is where Herne told me to leave you.  Farewell and godspeed, Robin." Katherine heads back down the trail, pausing for a moment to wave before disappearing into the trees.

You are at the end of the long road from Sherwood.  The road disintegrates into a path overgrown by grass.  The path is obviously long-unused.  It heads west toward a wooded area.

> w. s.
The path leads from the east, bends round to the south, then disappears at the edge of a forest.

You are in a wooded area.  Trees bow down above you; small twigs and dead leaves crunch beneath your feet.  There is a ruined shack to the east. Tracks lead off through the trees to the south and west.

You are standing in a ruined shack.  The floor is strewn with rubbish; cobwebs hang from the ceiling and brush against you as you enter.  You hear the sound of scurrying feet as a small rodent runs out into the trees.  The shattered remains of a pane of glass lie in one corner of the shack.

   There's a rusty shovel here.

> x glass. take it.

The glass is very dirty.  It certainly doesn't let the light through.  Oddly enough, however, its surface has become reflective -- you look in it, and can almost see your face.

The water fountain is made of heavy stone.  It appears to be quite old and is of strange design.  It contains no water, and you wonder what it could be doing out here in the middle of the forest.  Then, you discover the niche at its base.  A small key is hidden inside.

You pick up the small key.

With a little effort, you manage to move the fountain to one side, revealing a dark hole beneath.

You dig at the fallen earth and rocks with the rusty shovel.  It's hard work, but you manage to clear away the debris, opening up the tunnel again.  The effort is too much for the shovel, however.  Fortunately, most of the work has already been done.  You clear away the remaining earth with your hands.

The underground stream is cold to the touch.

Your search of the portcullis reveals a small, hidden door.

The door is small and well-hidden.  You can just make out the keyhole.

> unlock door with key. e. u. e.
You unlock the door, which swings open before you.

You suspect that you are now inside the castle walls, since the tunnels here are clearly man-made.  You hear muted voices ahead.  There is a rusting portcullis to your west, and a flight of steps leading up.

You are in the western cell block.  There are cell doors all around you, but they are open, and you can see they are empty.  You consider searching them, but the idea of being in a prison cell (even an open one) doesn't appeal to you.  There is a stone stairway leading down from here.  The cell block continues to the east.

You can hear the sound of footsteps to the east.

You are in the eastern cell block.  All the cells seem not to have been used for a long time, except perhaps the one to the south.  The open doors reveal empty cells.  To the north, there is an archway that looks as if it might lead into the castle proper. The cell block continues to the west.

There is a ring of keys here. ( hanging on the wall ) A well-armed guard is about to notice you.

> throw rock at guard
You throw the rock toward the guard.  It misses him, but he goes to investigate the noise.  While his back is turned, you approach him from behind and hit him hard across the back of the neck with both fists.  The Marquis of Queensbury wouldn't appreciate it, but Will would be proud of you. While the guard is lying unconscious on the floor, you put the boot in until you are sure he won't wake up again.

> take keys. unlock door. s
You pick up the key keys.

You unlock the door, which swings open before you.

The cell is small and dark, and has no windows.  The rough-hewn floor is strewn with straw, scant protection from the bitter cold of the stones.

   Elizabeth of Newark is here, looking bowed but unbroken.

You graciously help Lady Newark climb through the privy window and follow close behind her.  Then, the two of you run like hell toward the edge of the forest.

Unfortunately, a guard on the castle ramparts notices you.  A hail of arrows flies in your direction.  From the shelter of the trees, your companions return fire.  The guards duck for cover behind the walls, giving you time to reach the woods in safety.

In the back of your mind, you can hear a woman's soft voice counting: "Seven... eight... nine... coming up, coming back... ten... eleven... twelve."

Even with your eyes closed you can feel Magdalena's sharp gaze.  "That card made the boy happy, eh?  There were heroes and villains.  There was even a God to tell you what to do."  She laughs shortly.  "But you're not as simple as that.  You know if there's one side, there's going to be another."

Magdalena snaps her fingers.  "Come back to this world now, Austin.  Open your eyes.  Look around you."

As you concentrate on the Justice card, your eyes close, and you feel yourself descending into mist for a long, blissful moment.  "Seventeen... sixteen... relax and let go... fifteen... fourteen... you're falling, thirteen, twelve....

Somewhere in the back of your mind, you can hear Magdalena's voice speaking to you softly: "Your soul is also composed of what you KNOW to be true, in spite of what you would like to believe is so."

The voice fades as the world takes shape and form again.

You are alone in the great hall of Sherwood Castle.  The room is brightened by the light of the sun slanting through large windows.  There is a curtain hanging across the north wall.  You can see the guardhouse through an archway to the south.

> x myself.
[x -> examine]
You are the Sheriff of Nottingham.  The villagers of Sherwood Forest pay you taxes so you can defend them against the ruffians who inhabit the woods. Unfortunately, the outlaws regularly attack the troops who bring the money to Nottingham, and generally steal it all.

Because you can no longer pay your men-at-arms, no one is left to protect the local villagers.  The gang are taking full advantage of this, attacking whole communities.  The people must be protected, but how?  You are alone, but you still have a duty to perform.

You are in the Sherwood Castle treasury.  This dark room is kept hidden away from casual visitors.  The only exit is to the south, where the tapestry has been drawn aside.

   A money chest rests against the far wall.

> x chest. open chest. x coin. take coin.
[x -> examine]
The chest is solidly made, carved from oak and bound together with strips of iron.  It contains the villagers' taxes -- money they paid so you could defend them against the ruffians who inhabit the woods.  Unfortunately, the outlaws regularly attack the troops who bring the money to Nottingham, and generally steal it all.

Because you can no longer pay your men-at-arms, no one but you remains to protect the local villagers.  The gang is taking full advantage of this, attacking whole communities from their refuge in Sherwood Forest.  You are alone, but you still have a duty to perform.

   There is a single gold coin here.

This coin is the sum total of all the taxes you have managed to collect this year.  Well, that's not quite true.  You had collected more, but it was all stolen by the outlaw Robin Hood and his gang of wolfsheads while your men were returning to the castle with it.  This gold piece was all they left. The taxes were supposed to pay the armed men you kept here to protect the people of the countryside from ruffians such as Robin Hood, and to protect the realm if called upon by King John.  The King also takes a share himself. Too much, you often think, but he is the king, and that is the law.

You pick up the gold coin.

You are standing at the western edge of a small lake that nestles here in the middle of Sherwood Forest.  The lake seems to be well-stocked -- you can see fish jumping in the still waters.  There is a pier to the east.

As you pick your way carefully through the marsh, you discover a cave tucked inside a muddy bank.  A precarious path leads south, back to the water's edge.

   There is a fisherman standing on the end of the pier.

The fisherman is throwing his net into the water, and drawing it back again. Although fish are jumping out in the lake, he doesn't seem to be having much luck here near the shore.

The fisherman is happy to talk to you.  He's not having much luck today, so you're not likely to scare the fish.  He tells you that he wishes he could afford a boat.  All the best fish are out in the center of the lake, and don't come within reach of his net.  He'd sell the net in a minute for enough money to buy a small boat.

The fisherman gives you the net in exchange for the gold piece.  Looking happy, he disappears into the forest, presumably in search of a boat salesman.

All the trees in this part of the forest seem to be willows.  You suspect that you are near a lake.  Paths lead to the east, north and northeast.

You bend the willow's branches to the ground.  But as soon as you release them, they spring up into the air again.

Robin sweeps his blade low toward your legs, but you jump over it.  Before he can regain his defensive position, you thrust the torch into his face, and he is forced to back away.

You thrust the torch toward Robin's face.  As he raises his sword to parry the blow, you kick him hard in the groin.  The Marquis of Queensbury wouldn't have approved -- but then, he wasn't fighting for his life.

> hit Robin with torch
Robin leaps onto a table and strikes at your head.  You duck under his blow and strike at his legs with the torch, forcing him to jump down again.

As you swing the torch at his head, Robin must duck to avoid it.  He stumbles and falls to one knee on the rough stone floor.  For a moment, you have him at your your mercy.  But he snatches up a handful of dust and stones and throws it into your face.  Half blinded, you are forced back a step and the opportunity is lost.

> hit Robin with torch
Slipping around behind a pillar, you parry Robin's blow with the torch.

You thrust the torch toward Robin's face.  As he raises his sword to parry the blow, you kick him hard in the groin.  The Marquis of Queensbury wouldn't have approved -- but then, he wasn't fighting for his life.

You strike out again at Robin, but he anticipates the blow.  Stepping in close, he shoulder-charges you and you sprawl to the floor, losing the torch. Robin cleaves downward, but you manage to roll out of the way.

Surprised by your sudden move, Robin overbalances and trips over you.  As he falls, he loses his grip on his sword, which clatters onto the stone floor and slides away from him.

Stunned, Robin lies prostrate on the ground and you take full advantage. Snatching up his sword, you are ready for him.  When he comes to, he finds you holding his own blade to his throat.

In the back of your mind, you can hear a woman's soft voice counting: "Seven... eight... nine... coming up, coming back... ten... eleven... twelve."

Magdalena indulges in a few hearty guffaws.  "So who's the hero and who's the villain?  Did I trick you?  Don't give me that look.  You wanted your soul back and that's what you're going to get.  Did I say it would be easy?"

Magdalena snaps her fingers.  "Come back to this world now, Austin.  Open your eyes.  Look around you."

You are in a plain, white room.  The walls have an opalescent quality, as if you could almost see through them.  An elaborate design is painted on the floor.  Rising from the center of the design is an odd post, decorated in a spiral pattern.  A circular table surrounds the post.

There are some wooden matches here. ( in the box ) There is an earthenware jug here. ( in the box ) There is a piece of scented paper here. ( in the box ) There is a large mirror on the north wall.

It appears to be the room's center-post.  Though it has no branches or leaves, its markings make it look a little like a stylized tree.

Your weary face stares back at you from the great mirror, eyes like black caverns in the soft light.  Clouds billow endlessly behind your ragged reflection, their snowy depths lined with shades of gray and blue.  Pale flickers of heat lightning seem to outline shadowy forms beyond the clouds, but you can't make out what they are.

The table appears to be an altar of some sort.  A white candle, a large drum, and a white, lacquered box rest on its smooth surface.

The white candle appears unused.  It is mounted in a bleached human skull, and is firmly fixed to the altar.

The drum is handmade, from a hollowed-out section of an oak tree.  It is covered with cowhide held taut by sisal ropes, and is decorated with a smaller version of the design on the floor.  It is firmly fixed to the altar.

   There are some wooden matches here. ( in the box )
   There is an earthenware jug here. ( in the box )
   There is a piece of scented paper here. ( in the box )

The matches appear quite fresh.

The brown jug has a narrow mouth and two large handles.  Its mouth is stoppered with a large cork.  When you shake it, you can hear liquid inside. There is a label on the jug.

The scented paper seems very old.  It is decorated with the same design that covers the floor, and its text is in French, English, and a language you don't recognize.

> read paper.
The English version says:

Papa Legba, Lord of the Crossroads, Master of the Gate, commands the limitless wisdom of the great loa.  He stands between you, O serviteur, and the timeless realms of the spirits.  If you would know the past or the future, serve him well and he will aid you.

          O serviteur,
          Illuminate his Path and
          Slake his Thirst; then
          Make a Joyful Noise.

Talk with him, then SPEAK THESE WORDS to open the gate:

          O Legba, sonde miroir;
          O Legba, ouvri barriere pour moins;
          Tout Mystere 'gider moins, O Legba.

The white candle begins to burn brightly.

> open jug
Carefully, you remove the cork stopper.

> pour liquid on floor
The veve soaks up the clairin thirstily.

> play drum
As you touch the drum, it seems to take on a life of its own.  You hear an odd, syncopated drumbeat that sounds a bit like someone knocking on a door.

After a moment, a flash of white light bursts from the striped pole.  It circles around your head, giving you the distinct feeling that it is sifting through your mind.  Finally, it resolves into a human form.  The drumbeat ceases abruptly.

An elderly gentleman regards you curiously.

> talk to Legba
"Bon jou, ti blanc," the man says.  "You call upon Papa Legba, yet you are not a serviteur.  I tried to enter your mind, but I could not remain there."

Legba laughs, and pokes his walking stick into your ribs.  "It's true, then, that big loa cannot ride small horses."

His expression changes to one of fatherly concern.  "You are troubled, though.

Someone has stolen your ti bon ange -- your memories -- and you would like them back.  I can help you, though I cannot restore your memories alone. Ask, and I will try to answer your questions.  Speak the words, and I will be your guide."

> speak words
As you speak the strange words, the paper crumbles to dust.  Legba laughs and touches the mirror with his walking stick.  A blinding white light flows from his hand to the mirror.  Incandescent rivers of lightning course through the clouds behind its surface.  Thunder crashes around your ears, and you fight the urge to cower behind Legba's back.  In a moment, the storm subsides.

"Look again at the mirror, ti blanc," Legba says.

The mirror has become transparent, revealing a glowing passageway leading north.  Its surface shimmers with energy, but it looks safe to walk through. At the end of the passageway, you see an inviting tropical garden.

Papa Legba walks beside you, swinging his walking stick.

You've come to a small clearing in a tropical garden.  Bright, golden sunlight spills on the lush foliage all around you.  A gentle breeze stirs the huge leaves of banana trees, and rustles through stalks of bamboo.  Bougainvillea vines heavy with fragrant red and purple blossoms twine among the trees. Deep green pathways lead off in all directions.

There is a large mirror on the south wall. A small straw basket sits beside a shaggy pine tree. An elderly gentleman regards you with curiosity.

Before you can move on, a distraught aviatrix runs toward you, calling, "Fred!  Where are you?"

She looks to be about forty years old.  Concern and confusion are apparent on her handsome face.  She is wearing a tattered 'thirties-style flying outfit. She seems glad to see you, but disappointed that you're not Fred.  "Have you seen my navigator, Fred Noonan?" she asks.  "We were flying around the world, and something weird happened.  Now, I can't find him -- and I can't get off this blasted island!"

She searches the area hastily, and runs off.  You prepare to move on again.

It's not very impressive.  It's really quite small, with a thatched roof and no windows.

Papa Legba walks beside you, swinging his walking stick.

You step through the curtain into the courtyard of an expensive-looking villa.  Tall, sable columns march across the villa's facade, forming a shaded verandah.  In the courtyard's center is a black marble fountain.  An odd carving decorates the flagstones surrounding it.  Beyond the fountain lies a carefully tended formal garden containing a small cemetery.  A sleek, midnight-hued Maserati is parked nearby.  You notice that its gearshift lever is crowned with a small gold human skull.

An elderly gentleman regards you with curiosity. A handsome fellow leans casually against the Maserati.

You see a young man whose elegant, sculptured face is as black as his well-tailored Italian silk suit.  You're not sure why, but you're glad you cannot see his eyes, which are concealed behind mirror-lensed designer sunglasses.  A huge diamond flashes on his left hand as he flicks a speck of nonexistent dust from the Maserati's gleaming flanks.  In his right hand, a cigarette burns in a long, gold cigarette holder.  He smiles at you, and you imagine you feel an icy hand gripping your heart.

The carving looks like a veve, a symbol used to invoke a loa, or spirit, at Haitian vodoun ceremonies.  Its centerpiece is an ornately drawn tombstone topped with a cross.  The cross is flanked by two stylized coffins.  There is writing below the carving.

Ghede, Master of the Abyss, Eternal Guardian, Eater of Souls

> x fountain. ask Legba about Ghede.
[x -> examine]
The fountain's waters are black as a moonless midnight, and stream from the mouths of four marble gargoyles.  You can see your face floating eerily on the surface of the waters, but nothing more is visible in their inky depths.

"Garde-toi, ti blanc!  He seems out of sorts today.  Perhaps Erzulie has wounded him yet again.  I hope you have something that will please him."

> give case to Ghede
"Alors, mon petit malfacteur!  You have found my missing treasure!"

Ghede snatches the cigarette case from you and carefully polishes away your fingerprints. "You have done me a favor, so I must return it."  He thinks for a moment.  "Ah, I have it!  I'll show you some of my favorite home movies!" He waves his hand at the fountain, and you are surrounded by a black fog. As it clears, you find yourself...

...in the middle of a bloody revolution.  You are a Maroon, an ex-slave, fighting in the only successful slave revolt in history.  You have only the most meager weapons, but you and your comrades are fighting for your very lives.  There is death and destruction all around you.  Once-great plantation houses lie in smouldering ruins.  Corpses, black and white, litter the cane fields.  Ghede walks among them, smiling and nodding at his rich harvest. He sees you and waves cheerfully...

...and you are battling Napoleon's armies, Europe's finest, sent to retake the jewel of the French empire.  You have few resources, but you fight with extraordinary courage.  Within two years, sixty thousand veteran French troops have died, and your land is yours again.  The French belong to Ghede, who salutes you with a smirk...

...a hundred years of stagnation and instability flash by your eyes.  As your nation's economic health declines, your countrymen's thirst for coups d'etat grows.  Seventeen of twenty-four presidents are overthrown by guile or force of arms, and Ghede's ghastly armies swell.  With a sweep of his arm...

...you are a student, protesting the years-long American occupation of your country.  They came, they said, to thwart Kaiser Wilhelm's designs on the Caribbean, and to help the Haitian people.  But their callous rule soon became morally and politically bankrupt.  Chuckling, Ghede hands you a stone and you throw it.  The uprising that will drive the invaders out has begun...

...but you're now a longshoreman in Port-au-Prince, and your beloved Daniel Fignole has been ousted after just nineteen days as Provisional President. Rumors abound that he has been executed by Duvalier and his thugs.  You're taking part in a peaceful, if noisy, demonstration demanding his return. Suddenly, you're facing government tanks and troops.  Ghede rides on the lead tank, laughing and clapping his hands in delight.  You shout your defiance and pitch a rock at the tank.  The troops open fire, and machine-gun bullets rip through your chest...

...and you are back at Ghede's villa.

"Did you like my movies, casse-croute," Ghede grins.  "No?  Well how about this, then?  I've recently come into, ah, possession of someone you know," he says with a chuckle.  "He's a deliciously evil man, and convinced still of his own righteousness despite his embarrassing demise.  Torturing him is more fun than I've had in centuries!  Would you like to see him again?"

Yes or no?   

Please answer <y>es or <n>o. y
The black fog swirls around you again, and you are... yourself, walking down a long, marble corridor.  At a pair of large oak doors, a sign reads: House Committee on Un-American Activities, January 1953, Public Session.

You enter a large room that's filled to capacity.  You walk to the front of the room and sit at a small table.  Facing you is a high bench, behind which sit several grim-faced men.  In the center is a jowly, dark-haired man with a cigar -- Senator Joseph McCarthy, the most powerful man in the nation at the moment.  He scowls as you are sworn in as a witness.

"Mr. Garriot," he begins.  "You are an assistant professor of history at Georgetown University, is that correct?"  Yes, you answer. "Let's get one thing clear right away," he says.  "Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist party?"  No, sir, you say.

McCarthy stabs his cigar at you.  "Didn't you attend several Communist party meetings in the summer of 1945?" he asks menacingly.  Only one, you answer. A friend asked you to join a study group that was discussing new ideas, you tell him.  You were doing graduate work on the history of Western political thought, so you went.  It wasn't very interesting, so you never went back.

McCarthy leans forward and glares at you.  "Who was this friend, Mr. Garriot? And who else was at that meeting?"  You tell him that you'll answer any questions about yourself, but will not discuss the actions of others.

His face growing redder by the minute, McCarthy continues to press you for names.  He shows you photographs of yourself at a rally protesting the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and claims you were there as a member of a Communist front organization.  He says he has sworn testimony from one of your colleagues, naming you as a subversive thinker.  "I want to know your Communist buddies, Mr. Garriot." he shouts.  "I want their names now!"

You repeat your earlier answer over and over, citing your constitutional rights as an American to freedom of speech and assembly.  The exchange escalates into a shouting match as flashbulbs pop in your face.  McCarthy's voice booms over the crowd noise:  "Mr. Garriot, you leave me with little doubt that you are still a member of the Communist party.  I'll do everything in my power to see that you are no longer permitted to influence young minds with your anti-American filth!  You are hereby cited for contempt of Congress!" he screams.  "And you are dismissed!  Bailiffs, remove him! Next witness!  Call the next witness!"

Two burly officers hustle you back through the room and out the door.  Your career is ruined almost before you've left the building.  You're sure you'll lose your job, your friends, everything you've worked for.  You've been judged guilty by suspicion, but you stood by your principles...

...and you've returned to Ghede's villa.

You pass through the curtain into what appears to be a military command post. Maps and charts line the walls.  On a waist-high platform, tiny soldiers, tanks, jeeps, and field artillery seem to be frozen in a raging battle.  A securely locked cabinet contains small arms and ammunition.  Along one wall, an array of electronic equipment surrounds a television monitor.  A bold painting covers the floor.  The only exit is to the east.

An elderly gentleman regards you with curiosity. A tall, stern-looking officer paces rapidly back and forth.

> x officer. x painting. read painting
[x -> examine]
You see a powerfully built, middle-aged black man wearing a dark green military uniform.  His face is lean and strong, and radiates authority. There is a fire of urgency in his eyes.  He wears four gold stars on his epaulettes and shirt collar.  On his chest are more medals and battle ribbons than you can count.  A red sash stretches from shoulder to hip.  He carries a gold-tipped black baton.  He slaps it across his palm impatiently as he stops pacing and turns in your direction.

The painting looks like a veve, a symbol used to invoke a loa, or spirit, at Haitian vodoun ceremonies.  It is a spiky, four-pronged figure, with what appear to be banners on the outer prongs.  Another prong could be a stylized sword, and the last could be a starburst, or perhaps a rocket exploding. There is writing next to the painting.

Ogoun Feraille, Eternal Warrior, Prince of Power, Lord of Fire

[x -> examine]
The television monitor glows with energy.  Undecipherable words, signs, and symbols scroll rapidly across its surface.

"He can help you regain your ti bon ange.  Perhaps if you had a way to appeal to his vanity..."

> give weapon to officer.
You offer the Beretta to Ogoun, and his hard expression softens.  "It's a fine weapon, young human, and I thank you for it."  He holds the gun lovingly for a moment, then tucks it away in his uniform jacket.

"It's too pretty for an old soldier, though," he says.  "Better suited for a great statesman like Duvalier.  Do you know of him?"  You mutter something undecipherable in response.

"Ah," Ogoun says.  "He's going to be a great leader.  He understands how much our people yearn for law and order dealt out with a firm but fair hand.  Let me show you a bit of Haiti's future under Duvalier."

He plays with the electronics for a moment, and you are swept into the television monitor.  You find yourself...

...before a shining white city atop a hill.  A sign welcomes you to Duvalierville.   As you walk through the busy streets, well-dressed, cheerful people greet you as they pass by.  You are struck by the abundance of goods and services offered, and the cleanliness and order that prevails.  Almost every wall is adorned with a huge poster of a frail, gray-haired black man wearing a dark suit and horn-rimmed glasses.

Under the figure are the words:  "Je suis le drapeau Haitien, Uni et Indivisible.  Francois Duvalier."

Everyone you ask about the man says the same thing:  "We all love Papa Doc. He's our president for life now, and we pray that he will live forever." You ponder this vision for a moment...

...and are back in Ogoun's command post.

"It's a glorious sight, no?  But you've come for another reason, I know. Would you like to see what my monitor can show you about yourself?"

Yes or no?   

Please answer <y>es or <n>o. y
You look in the monitor again, and find yourself...

...in the Library of Congress back in Washington.  You're in the Main Reading Room, doing research for the book you're writing on the Lend-Lease Act of 1941.  It won't be a best-seller, but it may help you regain your status as a respected historian.  Since your encounter with "Tail-Gunner Joe" McCarthy a few years back, your career has been in a shambles.  Above you soars the Reading Room's ornate 160-foot-high domed ceiling.  On another day, you would have taken time to admire it.  But today, your work is all that counts.

A whispered conversation interrupts your concentration, and you look up in annoyance at two men who are standing near your table.  One of them is dark-haired and swarthy, and seems to be angry about something.  The other is small, with a shock of blond hair and piercing blue eyes.  The dark one looks a bit thug-like -- potentially violent, you think.  But there's something about the blond that makes you even more uncomfortable.

Suddenly, the blond waves the dark man to silence and looks across the room. You see two more men -- strong, athletic types in gray topcoats -- moving determinedly toward you.  Much to their displeasure, a tall, thin man dressed in black steps from the shadow of a marble column and intercepts them.

As you watch the three men quietly arguing, something jostles the chair next to you.  On the chair, your open briefcase is rocking, threatening to spill your precious papers all over the floor.  You turn to steady it, and find yourself eye-to-eye with the small blond.  "Sorry, old man," he says with an upper-class English accent.  You nod at his back as he hurries away.  When you look around again, the swarthy man and the three across the room have vanished.  With a sigh of gratitude, you turn back to your work...

...And find yourself back in Ogoun's command post again.

You've come to a small clearing in a tropical garden.  Bright, golden sunlight spills on the lush foliage all around you.  A gentle breeze stirs the huge leaves of banana trees, and rustles through stalks of bamboo.  Bougainvillea vines heavy with fragrant red and purple blossoms twine among the trees. Deep green pathways lead off in all directions.

Papa Legba walks beside you, swinging his walking stick.

You pass through the curtain into an elegant boudoir.  The air is cool and refreshing, with a delicate floral scent.  Pale pink watered silk covers the walls.  In a velvet-draped niche, ivory-painted wrought-iron lilies entwine on an antique bedstead.  Its lacy coverlet is dotted with silken pillows. Along one wall, a mauve velvet loveseat beckons.  A dressing table laden with perfumes, jars, and silver implements stands opposite.  The glittering contents of a rosewood jewelry box spill onto the table, throwing dancing patterns of light onto a heavy mirror with a gilded frame.  A complex pattern is woven into the thick ivory carpet.

An elderly gentleman regards you with curiosity. A bewitching beauty is here.

> x beauty. x carpet. read carpet
[x -> examine]
You see a dazzling young woman with skin like ebony silk and hair as black as the night itself.  Her features are exotic and exquisite in their finely balanced proportions.  She is wearing an ivory satin dressing gown trimmed in pink lace.  It whispers softly as she turns to regard you, its heavy folds revealing the merest hint of the voluptuous figure it drapes.  She smiles, and you feel a sudden weakness in your knees.

The pattern looks like a veve, a symbol used to invoke a loa, or spirit, at Haitian vodoun ceremonies.  It is a filigreed heart, with long, curled tendrils flowing from it.  There is writing woven into the pattern.

Erzulie Maitresse, Muse of Beauty, Spirit of Love

> ask Legba about Erzulie.
"I think she likes you, ti blanc.  You should honor her beauty."

> give orchids to beauty.
"Ah, quelle galanterie!" Erzulie exclaims as she accepts the orchids. "Tu m'aimes, mon cher!  Vraiment, vraiment, tu m'aimes!"

Her lovely face turns serious.  "Do you know why love and beauty are so important to my people," she asks?  "It's because they've known so much hatred and ugliness over the centuries.  Let me show you how things were when our land was young, and perhaps you'll understand us a little better."

She touches her mirror, and you are engulfed in a swirl of colors...

....and you are a proud Mandingue hunter in a hot West African land.  But you're not hunting.  You're being hunted -- by slavers, both black and white. You run, and run, and run, until your lungs are near to bursting.  But it's no use.  You're captured and chained like an animal, and thrust into the dank hold of a sailing ship.  Hundreds of your countrymen and women are here -- hungry, thirsty, some beaten and maimed by your captors.  All are terrified for themselves and their families, from whom they've been cruelly separated. Many die on the long voyage.  But when it's over, you wonder if perhaps they were the lucky ones...

...and you're a slave, toiling ceaselessly in a Haitian cane field for your French masters.  While they live bloated with wealth, you and your fellows know little but hardship and pain.  Brandings, floggings, rape, and killing are everyday events.  And for the slightest infraction, a man could be tortured to death by means limited only by his owners' dark imaginations. What little comfort you find is in the company of other slaves, who, at great risk to themselves, try to keep the traditions of your lost homeland alive. And there is hope -- some of your brothers could not be broken, and have fled to the hills to live free.  These men, the Maroons, are said to be training as warriors, and planning for your people's revenge.  Tonight, you think, under cover of darkness, you will slip away to join them...

...and you are back, safe with Erzulie.

Erzulie smiles and touches your cheek gently.  "But you came to me to learn of your own history, no?  My mirror holds some of your past, too, jeune mortel.  Would you like to see it?"

Yes or no?   

Please answer <y>es or <n>o. y
Once again you are drawn into the swirling colors.  You see... yourself, hurriedly stuffing your books and papers into your briefcase.  It's a long ride from the Library of Congress to Hilary's place, you think.  You're afraid you'll be late, and you couldn't bear the thought of hurting her.

Hilary... yes, now you remember.  How could you have forgotten Hilary -- so pretty, so bright, so alive.  She loves you, you think -- you hope.  And you know you love her with all your heart.

The scene shifts, and you are with her.  It's after dinner, and you're sitting on her couch, telling her some silly story about a faculty meeting. She listens with interest, her blue eyes sparkling with indulgent affection. Suddenly, she reaches over and silences you with a kiss.  And you are lost to everything but Hilary -- her eyes, her shining black hair, her sweet lips.

All too soon, it's time to leave -- you have work to do tomorrow, and it's getting late.  Reluctantly, you kiss her goodnight and depart, your head filled to overflowing with happy thoughts.

But wait!  From the mirror's long perspective, you see that you've forgotten something.  Your briefcase -- you left it at Hilary's!   As you try to force your mirror-self to go back for it...

...you find yourself in Erzulie's boudoir again.

The white hen has a floppy red comb, little yellow eyes and a wicked-looking beak.  She clearly doesn't want you anywhere near her nest, and clucks at you admonishingly.

Papa Legba walks beside you, swinging his walking stick.

You pass through the curtain into a thick grove of mapou trees.  Under the soaring branches, the grove has the stillness of a cathedral.  The deep green leaves throw dappled shadows on a sparkling pool.  The air is cool and fresh. Nearby, strange lines have been drawn in the moist soil.  You sense that this place is immensely old -- perhaps as old as time itself.

An elderly gentleman regards you with curiosity. A man-thick serpent coils in the largest tree.

> x serpent. x pool. x soil. read soil

The serpent's scales are iridescent.  In the soft light, they glisten with the colors of the rainbow.  Body rippling sinuously, the serpent glides down the tree and takes a position between you and the pool.  From massive coils, its huge, triangular head rises slowly to a height of about six feet, black tongue flicking in and out.  The serpent regards you with wise, golden eyes.

The pool's glassy surface reflects your face like a mirror.  Its clear water looks inviting.  You sense vast, impenetrable depths beneath its stillness.

The strange lines in the sand look like a veve, a symbol used to invoke a loa, or spirit, at Haitian vodoun ceremonies.  They depict a giant snake arched in the path the sun takes across the sky.  A wavy rainbow is reflected in the waters below.  An egg-shaped world floats serenely upon the waters. There is writing beside the lines.

Damballah Wedo, Good Serpent of the Sky, Steward of the World Egg

> give egg to serpent.
The serpent's jaws open, revealing fangs as long as your hand.  Gently, he takes the egg from your outstretched fingers, cracks its shell, and drains its contents.

Suddenly, a deep, resonant voice fills your head...

"I thank thee, little one," you hear without hearing.  "Thou art a brave and honorable man.  Thou hassst qualities Damballah favors in a human."

The serpent looks at you appraisingly for a moment, and speaks again.  "Thou art ignorant of our ways, though.  That thou mightst sssee us more clearly, I wouldssst have thee know of another sssuch man, among my people.  He isss Daniel Fignole, and he wissshes to lead my people.  Alasss, he has recently sssuffered a grave injussstice."

He moves away from the sparkling pool, and you find yourself drawn to its edge.  Looking into its depths, you see...

...a tall, ruggedly handsome black man with an engaging smile.

He is speaking to an assembled throng in a poverty-stricken city neighborhood.  He tells moving stories about his experiences as a teacher, journalist, and civil servant.  You admire both his skillful use of French and Creole, and his straightforward ideas about government.  With eloquence and obvious sincerity, he speaks of freedom, justice and opportunity for all, regardless of class or color.  His trenchant, biting criticisms of the establishment delight the crowd of longshoremen and laborers.

"Latin America and the Caribbean already have too many dictators," he says. It is time for a truly democratic government in Haiti."  The crowd roars out its approval, and...

...you are back in Damballah's grove.

"An evil man hasss denied him his chance to lead,"  Damballah says sadly. "But thou hassst sssuffered injussstices, too, I sssee.  "Wouldssst thou like me to help you regain the memory of one?"

Yes or no?   

Please answer <y>es or <n>o. y
You look again into the sparkling pool, and see...

...yourself, returning home from dinner at Hilary's.  You're thinking about nothing except her lovely face, her agile mind, and the life you'll share one day.  As you approach your door, an assailant grabs you from behind.  You struggle, but he's too strong for you.  Something strikes your head hard, and you slip into oblivion...

...and wake up, groggy and bound to a chair in a run-down old warehouse.  You are apparently alone, surrounded by boxes and packing crates.  Then, in the background, you hear muffled voices.

"...was I to know that he didn't have the damn briefcase!" says a harsh voice with an accent you don't recognize.  "...be careful with him, or we'll never find it," says another voice, this one in cultured American tones.  "...my brother!"  says the first voice.  "You and your precious CIA didn't seem to care about Shibley!  You let Raimone beat him to death, David!" the angry voice shouts.  "Shhhh," says voice number two.  "I think he's coming around."

You hear heavy footsteps approaching.  A swarthy, dark-haired man appears. You can't see his face clearly in the warehouse's gloom, but something about him seems familiar -- as if you'd seen him somewhere before.  He gives you a shove, rocking the chair backwards precariously.  "OK, prof,"  he says in the first man's harsh voice.  "Where is it?"

Where is what, you ask.  "The briefcase, man!"  he shouts, shoving you again. "C'mon, where is it!"  Why does he want my briefcase, you wonder.  And where IS the stupid briefcase, anyway?  You're hurt and scared to death, and your mind doesn't seem to want to do anything but yell at you to run away, which isn't very practical at the moment.  You remember having the briefcase at the library.  The library!  He was there!  But what happened after that?.

You tell your captor you've forgotten where you left it, and he becomes enraged.  He calls you a liar and demands the briefcase again and again, each time punching you hard in the ribs.  Finally, in exasperation, he hits you square in the mouth with his fist.  "That's for Shibley," he says as you and the chair clatter to the floor.  The lights go out...

...and you are back in Damballah's grove.

Before you can move on, a bronzed Greek hero strides into view.

He's muscular and athletic, and is wearing a brief tunic and sandals.  Over the tunic he wears a lion's pelt, the lion's head making a sort of helmet.  A stout club on a thong is slung over one shoulder.  He is taking notes on a clipboard as he looks around.

"Oh, hullo there," he says amiably.  "Don't mind me.  I'm just writing a walkthru."

He walks off, scribbling furiously.  You prepare to move on again.

A conch shell lies half-buried in the sandy soil. An elderly gentleman regards you with curiosity.

You pick up the conch shell.

The conch shell is quite large, and has a pretty brown-and-white spiral pattern.  Its throat is deep mauve, shading to pale pink.  Apparently, its original owner has passed on to gastropod heaven.  When you hold the shell to your ear, you can hear the sound of ocean waves crashing on a beach.

> ask Legba about shell
"It's a pretty thing.  Agwe might like it.  Blow in it and see what it has to say for itself."

> blow in shell
When you blow the conch shell, you hear a haunting melody that rises and falls in a minor key.  The song evokes images of the brilliant Mediterranean, the gray North Atlantic, the deep blue South Pacific, the turquoise Caribbean.  It seems to be calling across this vast domain, ruffling the waves in search of someone or something.

You pass through the curtain into what appears to be the captain's cabin on a square-rigged sailing ship.  The air has a salt-sea tang, and gulls cry in the distance.  The cabin's surfaces are immaculate, polished teak.  Ornate seashell carvings adorn a massive bunk bed.  A large desk littered with ocean charts and navigational instruments stands to one side.  In the exterior bulkhead, you see a brass-rimmed porthole.  There is a detailed drawing inscribed in the deck.  The only exit is to the west.

An elderly gentleman regards you with curiosity. A vigorous-looking seaman is studying the charts on the desk.

> x drawing. read it

The drawing looks like a veve, a symbol used to invoke a loa, or spirit, at Haitian vodoun ceremonies.  It is a stylized ship, with a cross-hatched sail and a sinuously curved anchor.  There is writing next to the drawing.

Agwe, Sovereign of the Seas

> x porthole. x seaman.
[x -> examine]
The glass in the porthole glows with energy.  Swirling patterns of gray and blue and silver prevent you from seeing beyond it.

You see a tall, whip-thin black man with graying hair.  He is wearing a crisp, white naval uniform, with bright brass buttons and four gold stripes on the sleeves.  He moves gracefully, but with a sinewy strength.  His face is sharp and hawklike, but he looks at you with a kindly expression.

> give conch to seaman.
The conch shell catches Agwe's eye at once.  "It's beautiful," he says, taking it carefully from your hands.  He cradles it as if it were a child, and traces its spirals with his long, thin fingers.  "The waters of the deep hold many treasures, but none could please me more than this."

A sudden sadness comes into his eyes.  "My beloved seas hold many terrors, too, though.  May I show you what's been troubling me lately?  It's only a fragment of the future, and may never be.  But it's a dreadful fragment."

He passes his hand across the brass-rimmed porthole, and you are lost in a silvery mist...

...you find yourself at sea, in a ragged little boat.  Every inch of space is crowded with humanity.  They're people you know and care about deeply.  You have no food or water, but you have something more precious -- hope.  In your native Haiti, your life has become intolerable.  The poverty, the fear, the sudden disappearances of so many people -- all have driven you to undertake this desperate journey into the unknown.

A storm arises, and your small boat is battered by the waves and torn apart. One by one, your friends, your brothers, your children slip beneath the roiling water and are lost.  You cling to a rotten board as long as you can, but you know that your dream of freedom is gone.  "Damn you, Duvalier," you scream as the water closes over your head...

...and you are back in Agwe's cabin.

"I'll try to prevent these tragedies,"  Agwe says.  "But even my powers may not be enough."   He looks at you for a moment.  "You've been harmed by water, too, I see.  Water containing an evil substance.  Would you like to see how it happened?"

Yes or no?   

Please answer <y>es or <n>o. y
The silver mist takes you again, and you find yourself...

...in a run-down old warehouse.  You're bound to a rickety wooden chair, and your body aches in a hundred places.  You touch your tongue to a painful spot in your mouth, and a trickle of blood runs down your chin.

You hear muffled voices coming from somewhere behind you.  "...no good, Michel," one of them says.  "He really doesn't know where it is."   Then another voice -- harsh and angry, with an accent you can't place.  "...use your precious serunim, then.  Maybe he'll lead us to it."

Things go black for a moment.  When you open your eyes again, a small man with a shock of blond hair is leaning on the crate in front of you.  He smiles at you, but his blue eyes are cold as arctic ice.  "Glad you're back," he says.  He speaks with an upper-class English accent, and you're sure you've heard his voice before.  But where?  Your brain sends you a fuzzy image of a library table, but it doesn't make any sense to you.

He unties you, and dabs at your cracked lip with a soft handkerchief.  "Sorry about that, old man.  Not cricket of Michel to strike a man who can't fight back."  He retrieves a pitcher from behind the crate and pours a tall glass full of water.  "Here," he says.  "Have a drink.  You'll feel much better in a little while."  You take the glass and gulp down the cool water.  "Just sit tight," he says, patting your shoulder.  "You'll be out of here in short order."  He leaves, and you drift into blackness again.

You awaken in a dungeon, surrounded by vampires.  Your head is spinning, and you can't quite focus your eyes.  There's a pitcher of blood on a coffin nearby.  A tall, thin, black-haired vampire -- Dracula? -- is peering into your face.  "See, Charles," he says.  "I told you the serunim would do it." "Quite right," says a small, blond vampire. "He's definitely over the top." A third, swarthy vampire hovers in the background, eyeing you hungrily.

Inexplicably, the vampires leave, and you're alone again.  The water, you think.  Something in the water...  You struggle to your feet and try to explore the area.  It's hard, because things keep shifting and changing. Finally, you find a door.  It's open, so you stagger out into the night...

...and find yourself in Agwe's cabin again.

You hear a sound like shattering glass.  Where the barrier stood moments ago, there is a vast, starry night sky.  The stars begin winking out, one by one.

Legba's image begins to fade as well.

"Adieu, ti...  Adieu, Austin,"  he says, raising his walking stick in a mock salute.  "You've regained all that was taken from you."

And he is gone.

Your vision blurs for a moment...

[Press any key...]
 
In the back of your mind, you can hear a woman softly counting: "Seven... eight... nine... coming up, coming back... ten... eleven... twelve."

Magdalena is almost purring.  "So now you know who you are, and you know what happened to you.  You're not a golem anymore."

Magdalena snaps her fingers.  "Come back to this world now, Austin. Your reading is not quite over yet.  Open your eyes.  Look around you."

> think on wheel.
As you concentrate on the Wheel of Fortune card, your eyes close, and you feel yourself descending into mist for a long, blissful moment. "Seventeen... sixteen... relax and let go... fifteen... fourteen... you're falling, falling, thirteen, twelve...."

Somewhere in the back of your mind, you can hear Magdalena's voice speaking to you softly: "What are you supposed to do with your vision, Austin? What happens now?"

The voice fades as the world takes shape and form again.

[Press any key...]
 
You are awakened to yourself by the sound of a walking stick rapping hard on a wooden floor.  You are startled, and Legba smiles.  "Did you think you would never see me again, mon ami?  I was your Magician, but did you think I lived in that card?"

He laughs kindly, and sets a hand on your shoulder.  "You are a piece of the Wheel, Austin.  However you turn it, kings will fall and people will die. But listen to me!  Their deaths will not be your fault -- as your father's death was not your fault."

Legba begins to fade, his shape becoming indistinct, his touch on your shoulder growing insubstantial, until only the resonance of his voice remains.

"You were part of the Wheel that day, too, so long ago, and that was what made you lose your ti bon ange.  Not those vampires, those men, but your own guilt and grief.  Now you know that, so now you are whole.  Spin the Wheel, mon ami. Spin it, and then let go."

In the back of your mind, you can hear a woman's soft voice counting: "Seven... eight... nine... coming up, coming back... ten... eleven... twelve."

Magdalena snaps her fingers, and you open your eyes and look around you. "If THAT one is your friend, you'll be all right."  She gets up from her chair with a sigh.  "You'd better go now.  You spent longer in this reading than you think.  Too bad about my niece, but you're too tall for her, anyway."

You walk toward the door, but Magdalena stops you one last time.  "Let me get that shmutz off you."  She spits on the corner of a silk scarf and wipes your face.  You thank her -- for everything -- and leave the shop.

On the street, you are surprised to discover that night has fallen again.

[Press any key...]
 
You are on the sidewalk.  The road is to your west, and the sidewalk continues to the north and south.  The door to the east has a weathered sign hanging on it.

> wait
You tap your foot nervously for a moment.  It doesn't seem to make the time go any faster.

> hail cab
You see a taxicab driving down the road.

You stick your arm out into the road, and the cab stops -- sluicing you with rainwater from the gutter.  Trying to ignore the state of your trousers, you jump into the taxicab.

"Where to, pal?" the cabbie asks, and you give him Hilary's address.

You are in the back seat of a typical Washington taxi -- dirty, and smelling of cheap whiskey.  Perhaps it was designed to complement its driver.

> x cabbie. talk to cabbie.
[x -> examine]
"We're there, pal!" the cabbie says.  "That'll be two dollars."

Dirty and smelling of cheap whiskey, he blends perfectly with his taxi.

The cabbie leans round to hear you better, and points out the back window. "I'm sure that's the same car that was behind us when I picked you up."

> give dollars to cabbie.
As you get out of the cab, you give the driver two dollars you "acquired" from the mugger. He drives away at top speed, splashing through a puddle as he goes.  Good thing your trousers are already wet.

You are on the sidewalk outside Hilary's apartment.  The wide street is lined with trees.  The light from the moon, now high in the sky, filters through the bare branches, creating interesting patterns of light and shadow on the ground.  Hilary's door is to the north.

It is raining heavily, and you are getting wet standing out here.

> knock on door
Hilary answers the door, her voice and expression full of concern.

"Austin, where have you been?  I've been so worried about you.  What's happened to you?  You're all bruised and bloody!  Are you in some kind of trouble?  You're all wet, too.  Come in quickly and dry off."

Gratefully, you allow Hilary to help you inside.

You are in Hilary's cozy living room.  Scatter rugs cover the wood floor, and pictures decorate the walls.  The furniture is very modern, steel and glass, although the sofa is leather.  There is a telephone on a small table in one corner.  The door to the south leads down to the street, and an open doorway to the west leads to Hilary's bedroom.  Hilary is here, her face a picture of love and concern.

   You notice your briefcase lying behind the couch.

> x Hilary. kiss Hilary. x briefcase. x telephone.
[x -> examine]
Hilary is a beautiful woman in her early thirties.  She has short, black hair, blue eyes, and a lovely smile.  You could never tire of looking at her.

Hilary responds passionately to your kiss, but she seems worried about what has happened to you since you last saw her.

It is a tan leather briefcase with the initials A.G. on it.

The telephone is black and looks just like a telephone.

> call police. call FBI.
The police suggest that you should call the FBI.

You dial the number for the local FBI headquarters, and explain about the incident in the Library of Congress, and what has happened since.

The agent at the other end promises to get to you as soon as he can.

> take briefcase. open it.
You pick up the tan briefcase.

You open the briefcase and have a look at what is inside.

There is a knock on the door, and Hilary answers.  Two men come into the apartment.  The first shows you an ID card and explains that he is with the FBI.

He introduces himself as Terry Smith, and his partner as Arthur Wesson.

There is a knock on the door, and Hilary answers.

Two men come into the apartment.  The first is a tall, thin man with black hair.  He shows you an ID card indicating that he belongs to the CIA, and introduces himself as David Thomas.

The second man is short, with piercing blue eyes and a shock of blond hair. Thomas introduces him as Charles Calthrop.

It is a pink-trimmed, beige folder with some writing on the cover. You open the folder and have a look at what is inside.

Eyes Only

Operation Jaguar

> x documents.
[x -> examine]
The documents are on CIA letterhead, and are marked "Eyes Only."

> read documents.
You scan the papers quickly.

The documents detail a CIA operation to assassinate the foreign minister of Haiti, Col. Louis Raimone, while he is in Mexico City to buy arms next weekend.  The operation is being overseen by Field Supervisor R. Davis.

An English assassin, Charles Calthrop, is to do the hit.  His contact in Washington is Michel Matalas, an American of mixed Haitian and Syrian descent. Neither man is directly associated with the CIA.

The papers indicate that the operation's overall goal is to overthrow Haitian President Francois Duvalier, and replace him with someone identified as "M. Daniel Fignole."

> x David. x Charles. x Smith. x Wesson.
[x -> examine]
Thomas is a tall, thin, dark-haired man with a commanding personality.  He reminds you a bit of Dracula in some of those old horror movies.

Calthrop is short and slim, and has blond hair and piercing blue eyes. There is a dangerous air about him.

It's hard to distinguish between the two FBI agents.  Both are hefty and athletic-looking, and both are wearing gray topcoats.

> talk to David. talk to Charles. talk to Smith.
"I'm the CIA's resident officer in Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti."

"I make no bones about my occupation.  I'm a professional assassin.  I'm not open to the highest bidder, though.  I pick and choose my contracts.  The people I kill all deserve to die."

The other agent turns to you and says, "I'm Smith, HE'S Wesson."

"Wesson and I are with the FBI.  We've been assigned to protect Queen Elizabeth on her visit to Washington next week."

> ask David about Haiti. ask Charles about Haiti.
"I didn't realize that the Queen was due to visit, but that doesn't affect our operation at all."

"I have no reason to do anything to the Queen.  I'm a strong believer in the monarchy, and would never harm her."

> ask Smith about Haiti.
The other agent turns to you and says, "I'm Smith, HE'S Wesson."

"Queen Elizabeth of England is due to visit Washington next week, and we're part of the team that's been assigned to ensure her safety.  When a known assassin arrives here, we're naturally concerned."

> ask David about Fignole. ask Charles about Fignole.
"Daniel Fignole is a good man, and would be a good president.  He wants to turn Haiti into a true democracy.  Some people have suggested that he's anti-American, and a Communist, but I've met him, and I don't believe he is."

"From what I've heard about him, Fignole is a good man and would be a good president.  He genuinely cares for his people.  I choose my jobs with care, and believe that I'm doing the right thing in trying to restore him to the presidency."

> ask David about Charles. ask David about FBI.
"Charles Calthrop is an Englishman, currently employed by the U.S. Government for an operation in Mexico.  He's here in Washington to be briefed on the mission.  Unfortunately, the FBI tried to intervene yesterday at the Library of Congress, and he had to dispose of some documents in a hurry.  He dropped the folder into your briefcase, and now we need it back."

"These men are FBI agents, sticking their noses in something that doesn't concern them.  Our operation is officially sanctioned, and is not taking place within the United States, so there's no need for their involvement."

> ask Charles about David. ask Charles about FBI.
"David Thomas is a senior member of your Central Intelligence Agency.  He contacted me two days ago, asking if I could help the CIA with a delicate foreign assignment."

"These men are FBI agents.  They've taken exception to my presence in the United States, despite the fact that my business is officially sanctioned. I don't really know why.  I've never done anything illegal in this country."

> ask Smith about David. ask Smith about Charles.
The other agent turns to you and says, "I'm Smith, HE'S Wesson."

"Thomas is the CIA's man.  He's normally resident someplace in the Caribbean. We're not really sure what he's doing back here in Washington."

The other agent turns to you and says, "I'm Smith, HE'S Wesson."

"Calthrop is an English assassin, a hit man.  We've had him in our files for some time now, though we don't know if he's ever killed anyone here in the States.  We don't know why he's here now, and with Queen Elizabeth's visit next week, we want to make sure she isn't his target.

"We spotted him at the airport, and followed him to the Library of Congress, where he met Matalas.  When Matalas handed him his instructions, we tried to arrest them.  Unfortunately, Thomas distracted us, and they got away."

> ask David about documents. ask Smith about documents.
"If you give us the documents, the operation will go ahead as planned.  The only evidence of our involvement will be buried away out of sight.  Haiti will be freed from Duvalier's despotism, and replaced with a true democratic government."

The other agent turns to you and says, "I'm Smith, HE'S Wesson."

"If you give us the incriminating documents, the CIA will be unable to go ahead with their plot because we will be able to implicate them.  If you give Thomas the documents, there's nothing we can do to stop the murder."

> ask David about Duvalier. ask Charles about Duvalier.
"Dr. Francois Duvalier recently took control in Haiti, a small republic in the Caribbean, after a rigged election.  He had his predecessor, Daniel Fignole, ousted in a coup.  He would have had him killed, but we managed to spirit him out of the country."

"Duvalier plans to turn Haiti into a bloody, repressive dictatorship.  The government doesn't want that; they'd prefer to deal with Fignole."

"Duvalier is no more than a murderer, and is prepared to do anything to retain power in Haiti.  Other than that, I'm not overly interested in the politics of the matter.  Of course, I do think about my contracts before I take them on.  In this case, I'm delighted to do the job."

> ask Smith about Duvalier.
The other agent turns to you and says, "I'm Smith, HE'S Wesson."

"I read about the Haitian election in the papers.  Duvalier was elected democratically, and is strongly pro-American.  Any attempt to overthrow him would be against international law, and we cannot condone such an operation.

"We will do whatever we can to keep it from happening.  If you would only give us the incriminating documents, the CIA will be unable to go ahead with their plan."

> ask David about Michel. ask Charles about Michel.
"Michel is the brother of Shibley Matalas, who was murdered by Colonel Louis Raimone, the Haitian foreign minister, a few days ago.  You may have read of his death in the newspaper.  He wants to avenge the death of his brother, and is helping the government at the same time."

"Michel wants to avenge the death of his brother Shibley, who was murdered by the Duvalier regime in Haiti.  If you want to know more about him, ask him yourself.  He's waiting outside."

> ask Smith about Michel.
The other agent turns to you and says, "I'm Smith, HE'S Wesson."

"We don't know anything about this Matalas guy, other than that he was Calthrop's contact at the Library of Congress yesterday.  We saw him hand over some papers to Calthrop, but when we tried to move in on them, Thomas stopped us.  We didn't realize the CIA was involved until then."

> ask David about Shibley. ask Charles about Shibley.
"Shibley Matalas was employed by the CIA in Haiti to gather information on the political situation.  He was murdered last week by Duvalier's foreign minister, Colonel Louis Raimone.  I saw his body, as an American government representative.  He'd been beaten to death."

"I don't know much about Shibley Matalas.  You'd better ask his brother Michel.  He's waiting outside if you want to talk to him."

> ask Smith about Shibley.
The other agent turns to you and says, "I'm Smith, HE'S Wesson."

"I remember reading about his death in the papers.  He broke the law, and turned himself in with the American consul present.  He died while trying to escape lawful custody."

> ask David about Raimone. ask Smith about Raimone.
"Colonel Louis Raimone is a thug who mascarades as Haiti's foreign minister. He murdered Shibley Matalas, Michel's brother and a CIA agent, last week. He's due to arrive in Mexico City this week to buy riot gear and weapons to equip a new secret police force in Haiti, the Cagoulards.

"I'm sorry to say that American companies are selling to him, although they can't do so through normal channels.  That's why they're meeting in Mexico." Calthrop is here to stop him from making that purchase."

The other agent turns to you and says, "I'm Smith, HE'S Wesson."

"I'm sorry, I can't tell you anything about that."

> ask David about serunim.
"Serunim is a hallucinogenic drug that the CIA has been experimenting with."

   Michel Matalas stands here with his back to the wall.

> x Michel. talk to Michel. ask Michel about Haiti.
[x -> examine]
Michel looks to be a bit of a thug.  Of medium build, he is dark-skinned and dark-haired.  You would guess that his parents were of African or Middle Eastern extraction, or possibly both.

"I'm an American citizen, although my family live in Haiti.  Originally, my grandparents came from Syria."

"I don't see what the Queen's visit has to do with my vengeance against Raimone and Duvalier."

> ask Michel about Shibley. ask Michel about Raimone.
"My brother was murdered by Raimone and Duvalier.  He was looking for a doctor for his wife, who was in labor, when he was arrested for breaking curfew.  He never even saw his son.  I want vengeance for his death."

"Raimone was the man who murdered my brother Shibley.  Duvalier was responsible for his death, but Raimone actually did the killing.  He beat him to death.  He deserves to die."

> ask Michel about Duvalier. ask Michel about Fignole.
"Duvalier is destroying the hopes of my people, and is responsible for my brother's death.  I want to see him overthrown, and Daniel Fignole restored to the presidency of Haiti."

"Fignole is the hero of my people.  They want HIM as president, not the dictator Duvalier."

> ask Michel about documents. ask Michel about FBI.
"If you give those papers to Thomas, everything will go ahead as planned, and my brother's death will be avenged.  That will never happen if you give them to the FBI."

"I don't know anything about either of them, except that they're trying to stop me from avenging my brother's murder.  They tried to intervene at the Library yesterday when I met Calthrop.  Fortunately, Thomas was there too, and distracted them long enough for us to escape."

> ask Michel about David. ask Michel about Charles.
"Mr. Thomas is the American vice-consul to Haiti, where my brother lived.  He saw my brother Shibley's body after he was murdered by Duvalier's thugs, and asked me if I wanted to help the CIA avenge his death."

"He's a hit man, who's going to assassinate the murderer of my brother Shibley, and overthrow President Duvalier of Haiti."

There is a telephone on a small table in one corner.  The door to the south leads down to the street, and an open doorway to the west leads to Hilary's bedroom.  Hilary is here, her face a picture of love and concern.

   David Thomas stares at you keenly.
   Charles Calthrop is taking in all the details of Hilary's apartment. Terry Smith, a hefty man in a gray topcoat, assesses the situation. Arthur Wesson, an athletic-looking man in a gray topcoat, surveys the scene.

> give folder to david.
Thomas takes the papers, and checks through them to be sure everything is there before passing them on to Calthrop.

Calthrop turns to you, and apologizes curtly for the way he treated you previously.  He thanks you for making the right choice.

Smith and Wesson are obviously upset at your choice, but Thomas warns them about the damage it would cause to the American reputation abroad if they tell the story to anyone.  National security takes precedence over any feuds between the CIA and the FBI.

They have little choice but to accept your decision.

Both sides of the conflict depart, still arguing.  You are left alone with Hilary.  Your ordeal is over, and you are back with the woman you love.

> kiss Hilary.
As you kiss Hilary, you realize just how much you love her, and wonder if she would agree to marry you.

> ask Hilary about marriage.
You ask Hilary to be your wife, and she gifts you with her sweetest smile.

             "Yes," she says, "I will marry you, Austin."

Queen Elizabeth's visit to Washington passed without incident.

Smith and Wesson were unable to provide any proof of the CIA's involvement in Raimone's killing, and they were censured by Hoover for the accusation.

The following Saturday, Colonel Louis Raimone died from a single rifle shot through the head as he disembarked from a plane in Mexico City.  His assassin was never caught, nor was any foreign government ever implicated.

It was estimated that the shot that killed Raimone was fired from a distance of 450 yards, from a Lee Enfield .303 rifle.  Very few professionals were capable of that accuracy over that distance; Charles Calthrop was one of the few, and the Lee Enfield was his preferred weapon.

Duvalier didn't survive long as president.  Without the riot equipment that Raimone had been sent to buy, he was unable to put down the waves of unrest that swept the country.  The army switched its allegiance to the people, and he was overthrown in March 1958.

Duvalier lived out the rest of his life in exile in Paris, and died in 1964.

Daniel Fignole returned to govern Haiti after Duvalier was ousted, and introduced an American-style democracy.  He served three 5-year terms of office, and was one of Kennedy's staunchest allies during the Cuban missile crisis.  He is still alive today, an elder statesman of Caribbean politics.

His brother's death having been avenged, Michel Matalas returned to his former job as a stockman in Philadelphia.  He joined the army and died in Vietnam in 1968.  His nephew, Shibley's son Mattieu, still lives in Haiti.

David Thomas returned to Haiti in his role as vice-consul, and became head of the CIA's Caribbean division.  He provided much of the intelligence that allowed Kennedy to bluff the Russians during the Cuban missile crisis before returning to take up a senior post at Langley.

Austin Garriot soon recovered from his ordeal; the beatings and the effects of the serunim left no lasting scars.  He returned to his research on Lend-Lease at the Library of Congress, and in later years published several books on American involvement in the World Wars.

Austin and Hilary were married in February 1958 and had two daughters, Bethany and Hannah.  They are still together today, after 35 years.

On their wedding day, a package arrived for Austin and Hilary.  Inside it was a mirror in an elaborately carved frame.  Behind its reflection, faint but clearly visible white clouds billowed in a tropical sky.  A note, written in a spidery hand, read:

You've chosen well, mon cher Austin.  I hope my little gift will prove helpful in your explorations of the past. May your life with Hilary be filled with blessings.

                                           Toujours ton ami,  L.
