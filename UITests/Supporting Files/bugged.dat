It is not clear what kind of building you are supposed to be in, but it looks like the setting is the not-too-original prison cell you are to get out of, in order to start the adventure for real.An open doorway leads south.A sturdy door in the southern wall blocks the only obvious exit from the room.A window, up close to the ceiling, breaks the monotony of the wall opposite. In the middle of the room there is a wooden table.The sturdy door blocks your way efficiently.You exit the cell.The window is too high for you.Second RoomYou are in a long north-south corridor. Torches set in the walls at regular distances from one another illuminate the place. Your cell is at the end of the corridor to the north, and there are other cells to both sides. About in the middle of the corridor there is a dark chasm in the floor, too wide for you to jump over.

Light is provided by burning torches high up on the walls. A suit of armour stands in one corner of the room and in another one is a chesstable.A heavy-looking stone door blocks further southward movement.There is now an open doorway to the south.Five levers protrude out of the western wall.You re-enter the second room.The stone door is in the way.You proceed south.Fourth RoomThis room looks very similar to the one to the north. However, the only decoration here seem to be beautiful wall paintings on all of the four walls.

Daylight streams in from a big window. A beautiful, ornamented door leads south, giving you a hint that you must be in an antechamber of some sort, leading to more central parts of the castle (for you have gathered by now that this must be a castle).You descend a flight of stairs and enter the dragon room once more.The ornamented door is very much in the way.Throne RoomYou are in a huge, rectangular room, very apparently the main room of the castle. Daylight pours in from windows in the ceiling. A throne stands in the middle of the floor, towards the western end of the room. There are two doors to the north and two to the south (the directions to be referred are northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast). A door to the east is more majestic than the others; you gather that escape lies that way, while a door to the west, behind the throne, is the plainest one of them all. In front of every door there stands a guard, alert and erect, and in one hand resting a spear against the floor.The guard in front of the door looks like he's not going to let you pass just like that.$n$t"It is not polite to leave while the king is talking."$n$t"Due to the recent escape, access to the prison wings is restricted even for the members of the royal family", he informs.$n$t"It's ok,", the princess says to you, "we just came from there, surely you don't want to go back?"The guard in front of the door looks like he's not going to let you pass just like that.$n$t"It is not polite to leave while the king is talking."$n$t"Due to the recent escape, access to the prison wings is restricted even for the members of the royal family", he informs.The guard in front of the door looks like he's not going to let you pass just like that.$n$t"It is not polite to leave while the king is talking."The guard in front of the door looks like he's not going to let you pass just like that.You approach the door.

Really, we'd better wait."The guard in front of the door looks like he's not going to let you pass just like that.Southern SidechamberYou are in a small sidechamber, adjacent to the throne room. The chamber is very barely furnished. There is a little window high up on the southern wall. An exit leads north.The window is too high for you."Good luck", the princess says, "I'll be waiting for you here."$n$t"Good luck", the princess says, "I'll be waiting for you here."$n$tYou exit through the window and drop down to the garden outside.You reach the window already.You start climbing the wall, but your foot slips soon after, and you fall back down.$n$tThe princess points at some exotic fruits in a bowl on a sidetable here: "You should taste these, they really are good for your dexterity."You reach the window already.You start climbing the wall, but your foot slips soon after, and you fall back down.$n$tThe princess points at some exotic fruits in a bowl on a sidetable here: "You should taste these, they really are good for your dexterity."Small GardenYou are in a secluded part of the garden surrounding the castle.

Otherwise, there is not much to tell; seems like your cousin has used most of his creative energy by now.DarknessIt is pitch black.You can't proceed any further without a light source.MeYou notice nothing unusual about yourself.Taken. - Nah, just kidding.You ask yourself whether that would be a wise thing to do.You can't do that.You can't tell yourself anything that you don't already know.You can't tell yourself anything that you don't already know.That would not accomplish anything.You can't do that.That would be needless.You can't insert yourself anywhere.$n$tThe double doors to the east swing suddenly open. It seems the king is entering the throne room now. Trumpets sound his arrival, and a crowd of servants, lackeys, advisors and other attendants follow him. The king climbs a couple of steps leading up to the throne and sits down.$n$tThe king starts talking. $n$t"My dear subjects! Two alarming matters have come to my attention. It has been reported to me that one of the prisoners has succeeded in escaping from the northern prison wing. You know, the one who was caught the other day after arousing suspicions by sneaking around in the castle's premises. The fact that the said offender has managed to break through our foolproof security systems, proves that we are dealing with a dangerous and cunning criminal who is to be searched for and captured as soon as possible."$n$tThe king continues his speech. $n$t"Secondly, I noticed my golden sceptre is missing. I don't know if these two things are in any way connected with each other, but in any case it is a very unfortunate thing, as the sceptre is a symbol of the prosperity of our country, not to mention a symbol of my power. I appeal to each and every one of you to keep your eyes open, in order that these two matters could be settled and got over with for good. Now, begone!" $n$tThe king stands up impatiently and walks out of the room with swift steps, some of his attendants following him, while others scatter hastily in different directions, trying to locate either the escapee (you try to look as small as possible) or the sceptre. $n$tHappening to glance at the princess, you notice that she is looking at you with an amused, knowing look, as if she was enjoying the situation.KingThe king is rather tall and not at all old yet; he has a golden beard, piercing grey eyes, and a red cloak on his shoulders.But the chess game would become unplayable then!You listen to what the king has to say.The king pays no attention to you.You have the feeling that the more you are able to avoid the king the better.

In this part of the garden, the king has some rare and precious flowers growing, and therefore the access there is restricted. The only way to pick up the ball would be through that window, but it is too high for me... but surely, it is no problem for someone as agile as you, is it?"$n$tThe princess is extremely happy after getting her ball back. $n$t"Oh, thank you so very much...! Well, I promised to help you, so listen: the sceptre is in the cellar which you can access through the door behind the throne, to the west. You'll need a lamp - here..." She bends down and pulls a lamp from some unknown nook or cranny in the wall and hands it to you. "Now, good luck!"$n$tYou can't hold on to the pug any longer. It squirms itself free from your grasp.$p$tYou try to think what might help. Maybe your cousin programmed the dog to be a container, containing the sceptre.

The sceptre has been found!" $n$tThere is a lot of excitement and commotion, as the king and his attendants soon afterwards hurry into the throne room. $n$t"I am extremely relieved and happy", he says, "please accept this little token of my deep gratitude, before you leave." He reaches into his pocket and gives you a handful of golden coins. "And welcome back here anytime, as you seem to be a good friend to our dear princess." The princess smiles at you sweetly. $n$tAn extra fanfare is blown in your honour, and you are escorted out of the castle and to the outer gates, from where you start walking along the road, into the next adventure. $p$tSuddenly, you feel a tap on your shoulder. Frightened, thinking one of the guards recognised you after all, you turn abruptly around, but only to see your cousin looking at the computer screen from behind your back. $n$t"Great, so I see you've finished it, well congratulations for that! How did you like it?" $n$tFor a while, you think of a diplomatic answer and finally say: "Er.. it needs some polishing yet... but I am not sure if that will actually help it get any better than what it is now", leaving your cousin wondering whether that was a complaint or a compliment. $n$tAnyway, $n$i *** You have successfully escaped from the castle. ***$pThank you for playing Bugged.$nHuh?[Invalid command.

Nevertheless, the "I've implemented ten rooms and I bet you can't make it through!" was a downright Challenge, a slap in the face with a glove; and of course you couldn't back up anymore. So, here you are in the startroom, looking around with a certain reservation, hoping that this time your cousin would have succeeded in creating something you could perhaps even enjoy a bit... $p$pBUGGED $n(c) 2001 by Anssi Raisanen $nProgrammed with ALAN v2.8 $nVersion 1.2 $nPlease type 'help' for instructions and other background info.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
