****************￼

After a few years floundering around flipping burgers and washing dishes after college, it felt good to finally have a real job. Too bad it had nothing to do with anything you’d studied in college. But you didn’t need your degree for this job. During the job interview, an unsuspected psychic talent had surfaced, and you’d managed to come off as an expert in psionics even though you didn’t even know how to spell it. You were so excited about that lucky break that you didn’t ask what project you’d be working on or where you’d be working. Foolish? Maybe. But they did offer you the job, and the pay was good, too good to sweat the small stuff. Plus, you knew you’d have time to do a little research before your first day on the job. Now all you had to do was study the material you dug up, and you and your newly-found psychic talent would be ready for anything your mysterious new employer wanted to throw at you.￼

****************￼

￼
Helicopter Interior
You are the only passenger in the spacious, luxurious cabin of a private helicopter that seats six people in first-class recliners. The soundproofing reduces the engine noise and the sound of the rotors to a background drone as the aircraft speeds through the air. There is a side window next to your recliner, and a small table is within easy reach. On the small round table you see a manila folder. ￼

Despite the luxurious cabin and comforting embrace of the recliner, you can’t help but feel a little anxiety about flying in a helicopter for the first time.￼

Your anxious thoughts are interrupted when an attractive woman wearing a stylish teal and black uniform emerges from behind a curtain at the forward end of the cabin and stands at the head of the aisle.￼

“We are expecting a smooth, uneventful flight, Mr. Wayne,” she says. “My name is Janet and I’ll be your hostess. Please remain seated until we land.” ￼

> TT JANET
 “Hey, ah, excuse me,” you say to Janet. “This is my first day on the job, and I’m still trying to sort things out.”￼

“No problem,” she replies. “What do you want to talk about?”

    Advice￼

> T JANET
 “So, tell me a little about yourself.”￼

“I’m not supposed to talk about personal things with the passengers,” she says politely. “But since you asked nicely, I’ll bend the rules a little. Before I met our employer Andrew Wyldkynd, I was just one of those people who drift through life without purpose or direction. Now I have an interesting job that I take some pride in.” ￼

> T ANDREW
 “So how did you meet Andrew Wyldkynd?”￼

“Well, he used to come in to the restaurant where I was waiting on tables to eat dinner. We would get to talking about things when business was slow,” Janet replies. “One day he told me that he had started a secret project  on the private island that is our destination. He said that he needed a stewardess for the private helicopter he was going to use for flying supplies and people out to the island. The rest is history.” ￼

> T SECRET PROJECT
 “What can you tell me about this secret project I am going to be working on?”￼

“Well, I suppose that there is no harm in telling you what little I know.” Janet replies. “I overheard Albert Abrams  talking to one of Wyldkynd’s scientific consultants who was an expert in quantum theory. But all I could understand was that the consultant thought that what Mr. Wyldkynd wanted to do was impossible. Mr. Abrams just smiled knowingly and didn’t reply to that.” ￼

> T ABRAMS
 “So, what do you know about my boss Albert Abrams?” you ask Janet.￼

“He is the son of Dr. Albert Abrams,” she replies. “Rumor has it that he was privy to his father’s secret investigations into psionics. The medical machines his father built and sold were just to gain the resources required to pursue those studies. The people who bought them didn’t have the talent to operate them successfully, so his father was branded a fraud. But the son continued researching psionics where his father left off and managed to make some discoveries on his own. He’s pretty darn sharp, but is seems to me that he made a big mistake with your predecessor.￼

> T PREDECESSOR
 “OK, you got me curious. No one even told me that someone had my job before me.” ￼

Janet looks over her shoulder before speaking.￼

“Well, all I know is rumors, and it all happened three years ago, so I’ve forgotten some of the details. Her name was Adriana, and Mr. Abrams had some kind of problem with her. I don’t know what the problem was, but he had to leave the island to recruit a new assistant afterward, so it must have been something pretty bad. Now what’s really strange is that I never saw her leave, and there’s no other way off the island besides this helicopter. The whole thing is kind of a mystery as far as I’m concerned.” ￼

> T DESTINATION
 “I know it sounds silly, but I don’t know much about our destination. I got so excited about getting this job, that I forgot to ask my boss for details.”￼

“Sorry,” Janet tells you. “If Mr. Abrams has not yet told you about where you’ll be working, it’s not for me to do so.” ￼

You hear a soft ‘ding’ from somewhere forward. “Excuse me for a moment,” Janet tells you as she steps behind the curtain. “I have to check in on the pilot. I’ll be back in a minute or two.” ￼

Dear Mr. Wayne,￼

I was impressed by your psychic powers as demonstrated by the fact that you were able to use my Hieronymus Machine to obtain a perfect identification of the eloptic radiation given off by gold. And, I was further impressed by the fact that you were able to operate the machine without asking me for instructions.￼

Since it’s taken me three years of interviewing people in a dozen cities to find someone with that particular combination of instinct and psychic talents, I don’t wish to let you get away. Therefore, I am offering you the job as my laboratory assistant at the salary we discussed during our interview. Your duties will be to assist me with a secret project, the nature of which I will reveal to you when you arrive for your first day of work.￼

If you accept my offer, use the enclosed credit card to buy yourself a new outfit suitable for tropical weather. A limo will pick you up two weeks from now to take you to a private airport, where the company helicopter will fly you out to the job site.￼

Yours truly,￼

Albert Abrams.

Janet emerges from behind the curtain and stands at the head of the aisle.￼

(first removing it from the folder)￼

It’s a clipping from a newspaper. ￼

——————-
As you’ve seen, the name Albert Abrams pops up in several conspiracies that purportedly involve paranormal manifestations for some of the secret societies mentioned elsewhere in this article. However, the man himself remains shrouded in mystery. He made some incredible discoveries in a field referred to as psionics, but no one knows much more than that about him. Five years ago, at the height of his career, he vanished from the public eye to work on a secret project personally funded by Andrew Wyldkynd, the fabulously wealthy philanthropist.￼

Since Wyldkynd has hired permanent employees and temporary consultants with expertise in quantum physics over the last few years, you would expect that these people could shed some light on what he is up to, but such is not the case. None of these experts will comment on the nature of their work for Wyldkynd. Consequently, this author wonders what is really going on behind this particular set of closed doors.
——————-￼

A handwritten annotation on the margin of the clipping says: San Andreas Sentinel - 9/17/12 - excerpt from ‘Contemporary Conspiracy Theories’ ￼

A muted chime sounds from the front of the aircraft. “Excuse me for a moment,” Janet says. “I have to stow some supplies. I’ll be back in a few minutes.” She steps behind the curtain and you hear a few clicks and clanks every now and then as she works.￼

(first removing it from the folder)￼

It’s a printout of a Wikipedia article, where a paragraph has been underlined. ￼

—————-
Andrew Wyldkynd is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is widely considered the most successful investor of the 20th century. He recently retired from his business saying only that he was going ‘to pursue his childhood dreams,’ and has since become a bit of a recluse. People close to him have made very few comments on the nature of those dreams. The only comment ever made by Wylkynd himself was on a talk show. When asked what drove him to acquire his wealth, he said simply: “In my youth, I had a series of lucid dreams in which I met my true love, but meeting her in the flesh is turning out to be an elusive goal and quite expensive.” He refused to elaborate.

Eloptic Energy￼

All matter emits a kind of ‘radiation’ that is not electromagnetic, but exhibits some of the characteristics of both light and electricity. The particular frequency and modulation of this emanation is unique to every kind of matter, and therefore can be utilized for detection and analysis. Dr. Thomas Galen Hieronymus coined the term ‘eloptic energy’ to give a name to this radiation (from the words ‘electrical’ and ‘optical’). Psionic machines are often designed to detect and manipulate eloptic energy.

This excerpt has been cut out of a magazine article. ￼

Psionic Machine Theory￼

A psionic machine is a device that incorporates the human mind in its synergistic set of components or its circuitry. The theory behind psionics is based on quantum physics. All matter in the universe is composed of small packets of energy known as quantas. Quantas are the smallest discrete quantity of some physical property that a physical system such as an atom or molecule can possess. Each quantum pulsates or resonates at a particular frequency. Consequently, each atom has a slightly different frequency depending on its type. Thus, each physical thing (being made up of a unique combination of atoms and/or molecules) has its own unique frequency. However, it is entirely possible (though rare) for two objects or areas to have nearly the same frequency. In such cases, there will be a resonance between the two objects or areas and energy can flow between them.￼

Furthermore, against all logic, quantum theory has found that an affinity exists between two resonating objects that forms a link between them no matter how much distance separates them. Consequently, there exists the potential for non-local effects (correlations without connections) between the objects.￼

The human mind, a non-physical entity, contains an almost countless number of thoughts when you consider both the conscious and subconscious. And since each thought, among its many other properties, has a unique frequency, the human mind as a whole has a constantly varying fundamental frequency that is modulated into a unique complex waveform by the countless harmonic frequencies of the thoughts it contains. Thus, a psionic machine that incorporates a human mind into its operation can be tuned by the thoughts in that mind to exploit the resonance link between two similar objects to achieve a variety of effects.
——————- ￼

Janet emerges from behind the curtain and stands at the head of the aisle. ￼

You hear a faint grinding noise followed by a brief high-pitched whine. You become worried and look around in alarm. ￼

“Don’t worry about that sound,” Janet tells you. “It’s just the noise the landing gear makes when the pilot prepares the helicopter for landing.” ￼

> WAIT
Time passes...￼

> WAIT
Time passes... ￼

You feel a thud through the floor of the helicopter. ￼

“Looks like we’ve landed,” Janet informs you as she pulls the curtain aside and hooks it in place. “You may disembark now.”￼
￼

> OUT
You stroll past Janet and out the exit. She waves goodbye and then closes the door to the helicopter as it rises from the landing pad and speeds away.￼

Landing Pad
The landing pad is a paved area about 50 feet in diameter. The downdraft from the helicopter has swept it clean, leaving debris scattered at the base of a dense wall of trees that surrounds this man-made clearing. There is a beacon off to one side of the pavement. A dirt path penetrates the wall of trees to the north. ￼

As the sound of the helicopter fades away into the distance, you step into the center of the deserted landing pad to wait. The letter implied that Abrams would be here to greet you, and that was certainly a reasonable expectation. You wait a minute or two in the silence.￼

“Hey!” you shout. “Anybody here?”￼

A distant bird call breaks the silence. There is no other response.￼

> X PEDESTAL
The haze gray, round pedestal is made of steel and is about three feet in diameter and about two feet tall. There’s nothing on the beacon pedestal. You notice that the pedestal has a battery drawer, which is closed.￼

> X DRAWER
The drawer is made out of thick plate steel. It is painted haze gray. The drawer is closed.￼

> OPEN DRAWER, GET BATTERY
You open the battery drawer. The battery drawer contains a storage battery.￼

(storage battery) Taken. The beacon light stops blinking.￼

> n
You trip over something. You look down and see a long stick in the debris.￼

> GET STICK
(the long stick) Taken.￼

> NORTH, NORTH, NORTH
The light grows dimmer as you leave the landing pad and enter the forest. The branches of the massive trees have made a canopy overhead that is so thick you can’t even see the sky.￼

Forest (south)
The forest makes a green wall on both sides of the path. You peer through the foliage but can’t see much further than about ten feet in any direction. A dirt path runs north and south.￼
￼

Unicorn View
The trees are very thick on the west side of the path, but they thin out a little on the east side. The spacing between them is wide enough in that direction that you can see what appears to be a sunlit clearing about fifty yards away. The path runs north and south. ￼

You see a movement in the trees on the far side of the clearing and watch in wonder as a beautiful, pure white unicorn with a shining gold horn steps into the sunlight. It turns its head and stares directly at you. You lock eyes for a moment. The unicorn breaks eye contact first and lowers its head. It paws the ground twice with its left front hoof, and then it dissolves into thin air. An apparition? A hallucination?￼
￼

Forest (north)
The forest is a little thinner here and you can look through the trees and undergrowth and see for a hundred feet or so on all sides. To the north, the path leads to what looks like a door set into an entrance alcove at the foot of a hill. To the south, the path leads through the forest. ￼

You hear a whirring from the north that seems to be coming closer and closer. You look in that direction and see a fairy flying rapidly towards you, looking for all the world like she flew right out of the pages of a book on mythology.￼

Suddenly she darts downward. A coiled snake that had lain still and unnoticed until that moment strikes at her. It narrowly misses as she darts back upward. The snake quickly coils itself into striking position again. It sways its head to follow the movements of the fairy. The fairy seems afraid to try another attack.￼

She hovers in the air and gives you an anxious pleading look. When you just stand there looking at her in amazement, she does a clever little pantomime that makes it look like she wants to talk to you. ￼

The rattlesnake ignores you and watches the fairy. It shows no inclination to move off the path leading north. ￼

The forest fairy is here.￼

> POKE SNAKE WITH STICK
You timidly prod the snake with the long stick. The snake rattles its tail to make an angry buzz and strikes at the long stick. You give it another try and the snake slithers off into the forest. ￼

The fairy does a little victory dance in the air and looks at you in admiration for a moment.￼

> NORTH
The fairy races ahead of you down the path. ￼

When you step into the clearing in front of the hill and approach the archway, you notice a door in the alcove. It makes a low humming sound and slides to the left about a quarter of an inch before lurching to a stop. The display screen next to the door flashes a couple of times and displays a message in red lettering. ￼

The fairy hovers in the air in front of the entrance alcove and gives you a pleading look. She turns and pounds her tiny fists on the door forlornly for a moment. When she turns back to face you, her shoulders sag dejectedly as if the situation were hopeless.￼

Laboratory Entrance
You are standing in front of a shallow alcove in the south side of a forested, earth-covered dome. The alcove and the area in front of it are paved in cobblestones. The front door of the dome is to the north and it’s currently open about a quarter of an inch. The main path leads south, while a secondary path leads northwest to curve around the side of the dome. A third, seldom-used path leads southwest through the forest to an unseen destination.￼

There is a small display screen on the side of the alcove next to the door right at eye level that is showing some sort of status message. ￼

The forest fairy is here.￼

> X SCREEN
The words on the display screen are in flashing red letters that currently say:￼

DOOR IS NOT OPERATIONAL
    LOW VOLTAGE FAULT ￼

As you step away from the display screen, you step on a small object that is embedded between two of the cobblestones. You look down and see a bobby pin lodged between two of the cobblestones.￼

> X OBJECT
It’s a flat wire hairpin whose prongs press tightly together that is used to hold bobbed hair in place. (In Britain they call a bobby pin a grip.)￼

> GET IT
(the bobby pin) Taken.￼

> SW
Solar Panel Meadow
There are several rows of solar panels in this grassy area. There is a large shed here with a sturdy door. You are standing in front of the shed door, which is directly south of you. The path leads northeast back to the laboratory entrance.￼

> OPEN DOOR WITH PIN, IN
You unlock the door and open it.￼

You enter the shed.￼

Battery Shed
The interior of the battery shed is fairly large, about ten feet square and eight feet tall. Each side wall has three wooden shelves. Each shelf holds four large storage batteries. Each battery has a small indicator light built into the side facing the interior of the room. The sunlight pouring in through the open door provides plenty of illumination. The door is north. ￼

One of the indicator lights is out, which probably means that there is a dead battery that warrants a closer examination to see what the problem is. A recycle bin for disposing of dead batteries sits at the rear of the room.￼

> REPLACE DEAD BATTERY
You remove the dead battery and drop it into the recycle bin. Then, you place the beacon battery on the shelf, and connect it to the busbars. The indicator light in the beacon battery glows brightly.￼

> OUT, NE
You exit the shed.￼

Solar Panel Meadow
There are several rows of solar panels in this grassy area. There is a large shed here with a sturdy door. You are standing in front of the shed door, which is directly south of you. The path leads northeast back to the laboratory entrance.￼

The front door of the dome slides open as you approach the entrance to the dome. ￼

The fairy hovers in front of the door. Her tiny face is contorted with worry and she is frowning at you. She points to the open door and shrugs her shoulders helplessly.￼

Laboratory Entrance
You are standing in front of a shallow alcove in the south side of a forested, earth-covered dome. The alcove and the area in front of it are paved in cobblestones. The front door of the dome is to the north and it’s currently wide open. The main path leads south, while a secondary path leads northwest to curve around the side of the dome. A third, seldom-used path leads southwest through the forest to an unseen destination.￼

There is a small display screen on the side of the alcove next to the door right at eye level that is showing some sort of status message. ￼

The forest fairy is here.￼

> IN, IN
You enter the dome and the door closes behind you. ￼

The fairy follows you into the dome.￼

Laboratory Entry
This small room is just inside the front door of the dome. The front door is to the south, and there is a swinging door to the north that says: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. ￼

The fairy is hovering in the air and staring intently at the swinging door. She seems worried and it looks like she wants you to go in ahead of her.￼

You push your way through the swinging door and it swings shut behind you. You notice that the spring that keeps the door shut is strong enough to prevent small animals and snakes from using the automatic front door to enter the laboratory. The nimble fairy manages to fly ahead of you into the interior of the dome.￼

Laboratory
You are confronted with a strange site as you enter the laboratory. A large steel arch stands in the middle of the laboratory and Albert Abrams is lying on the floor in front of the arch struggling to untie himself from the ropes that bind him. A ghostly apparition of a beautiful young woman stands near him. She is holding what appears to be a laboratory notebook. She is methodically tearing pages from the notebook and dropping them into a metal wastebasket where a small fire is burning.￼

The fairy races past you and hovers in the air over Abrams. She gives a few futile tugs on the ropes. The apparition pauses in its work to swat at her, but the fairy dodges nimbly and zaps the hand that holds the notebook with a spark from her finger tips. The woman jerks her hand away with a start and drops the notebook. The fairy mounts a frenzied attack and relentlessly zaps every exposed piece of ghostly flesh she can get to.￼

After a dozen shocks, the woman turns away from the fairy and vanishes into thin air.￼

The fairy hovers over Abrams and gestures at you to come over and do something instead of standing there gawking.￼

“Nick!” Abrams exclaims. “Am I ever glad to see you. Lend us a hand and get these ropes off me, will you?”￼

A standard office wastebasket is here. A wisp of smoke rises from it. A laboratory notebook is here.￼

> OUT, OUT, NW
Laboratory Entry
This small room is just inside the front door of the dome. The front door is to the south, and there is a swinging door to the north that says: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.￼

The door silently slides open for you and closes after you exit the dome.￼

Laboratory Entrance
You are standing in front of a shallow alcove in the south side of a forested, earth-covered dome. The alcove and the area in front of it are paved in cobblestones. The front door of the dome is to the north and it’s currently tightly shut. The main path leads south, while a secondary path leads northwest to curve around the side of the dome. A third, seldom-used path leads southwest through the forest to an unseen destination.￼

There is a small display screen on the side of the alcove next to the door right at eye level that is showing some sort of status message. ￼
￼

Dumpster
This small clearing at the west side of the dome is surrounded by dense forest. A dumpster is positioned next to the dome. There is a post next to the dumpster. A path leads around the dome to the northeast and around the dome to the southeast. ￼

> GET HANDLE
(the metal handle) Taken.￼

> PUT HANDLE IN HUB
You insert the metal handle in the slot in the hub.￼

> PULL HANDLE
You pull on the handle and the dumpster lid ratchets open a couple of inches. You keep working the handle up and down to open the lid about half way. The latching mechanism lets out a squeal when you stop working the handle, and the lid drops about a quarter of an inch before coming to a precarious rest in the half-open position. ￼

You hear a whirring of wings and turn to see the fairy hovering in the air watching you.￼

> LOOK IN DUMPSTER
You reach up and grab the top edge of the dumpster, then you pull yourself up so you can look over the side. You see: a small trash pile, flower pot, some useless debris and a pocket knife.￼

> GET KNIFE WITH STICK
You use the long stick to drag the pocket knife closer and then you pick it up. ￼

The fairy does a happy dance then waves goodbye as she flies away.￼

> SE, IN, IN, CUT ROPE WITH KNIFE
The front door of the dome slides open as you approach the entrance to the dome.￼

Laboratory Entrance
You are standing in front of a shallow alcove in the south side of a forested, earth-covered dome. The alcove and the area in front of it are paved in cobblestones. The front door of the dome is to the north and it’s currently wide open. The main path leads south, while a secondary path leads northwest to curve around the side of the dome. A third, seldom-used path leads southwest through the forest to an unseen destination.￼

You enter the dome and the door closes behind you.￼

Laboratory Entry
This small room is just inside the front door of the dome. The front door is to the south, and there is a swinging door to the north that says: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.￼

You push your way through the swinging door and it swings shut behind you. You notice that the spring that keeps the door shut is strong enough to prevent small animals and snakes from using the automatic front door to enter the laboratory.￼

Laboratory
The circular laboratory occupies most of the dome’s interior. A large steel arch stands in the middle of the laboratory. It has a control panel mounted on the front of its right leg. A copper-clad table is attached to the leg below the control panel. A copper box sits on top of the table. An elaborate wire web spans the opening of the arch from top to bottom and from left to right. The exits and entrances to other rooms are around the perimeter of the laboratory. The laboratory entry is to the south; the mud room is to the north; the storage room is to the northwest; the lab assistant’s room is to the east; and Abrams’ room is to the northeast.￼

A standard office wastebasket is here. A wisp of smoke rises from it. A laboratory notebook is here. ￼

Abrams is bound with ropes and waiting for you to free him. The fairy tugs at the ropes that bind him, but she is far too small to have any effect on them. She looks up and gestures at you to come and do something. ￼

“Nick, please get these ropes off me,” Abrams tells you.￼

You use the sharp edge of the pocket knife to cut the rope. After you cut the ropes that bind Abrams, he gets to his feet and shakes your hand. ￼

“Well done, my good fellow. Well done,” he says as he rubs his arms to restore the circulation.￼

Then he turns and walks over to the web with a look of grim determination. He shakes his head as he looks the web over.￼

“Just look at this,” he tells you. “I never expected to see Adriana again, much less have her come back here and sabotage the project like this.”￼

He turns to you and sighs deeply before speaking. “Nick, your role in the project has changed, and we need to talk about it.”￼

 “Oh, I agree that we need to talk, “ you tell Abrams. “On my first day on the job, I end up being left on a remote island with no one to greet me. Then a real live fairy shows up to lead me to a laboratory that I have to figure out how to get into. Once inside the laboratory, I find my boss tied up and at the mercy of some kind of apparition. Oh, and I saw a unicorn. A unicorn, for crying out loud! Just what kind of project have I gotten myself into?”￼

“First of all,” Abrams begins, “I admit that you’ve been ill-treated. That was not my intention. I was supposed to meet you at the landing pad and explain the project to you before you encountered oddities like the fairy and the unicorn. But, as you’ve seen, Adriana showed up and spoiled that plan.￼

As for the project, here is a job description that I wrote for you before Adriana managed to sabotage the project. Things have changed since I wrote it, but it covers the basics. Read it before you start to work so I can tell you what’s changed. If you’re up for some optional reading, take a look at this project background handout I wrote for you. It will answer a lot of your questions about the project, but you really don’t need to read it unless you’re curious about how all this came to pass.” ￼

JOB TITLE: Laboratory Assistant￼

PRIMARY DUTIES:
     * Tune a psionic machine that creates a portal that connects our universe to a pocket universe whose natural laws are very similar ours. More specifically, it connects Earth to Heartha, which is a planet in the pocket universe that is nearly identical to Earth.
     * Scour the island to find the objects required to tune the portal.
     * Once tuned, you are to use it to transport Andrew Wyldkynd, our employer, to Heartha where he intends to live out his life in peace away from the violent, polluted, poverty stricken, overpopulated world that Earth has become. ￼

As you finish reading the job description Abrams walks up to you and puts his hand on your shoulder.￼

“Of course I wrote that job description before Adriana showed up to sabotage the project,” he tells you.  “As things stand now, you are still going to have to do everything in the job description except taking Wyldkynd to Heartha. Once you get the portal tuned, you are going to have to go to Heartha yourself. Once there, you will have to find Adriana, talk some sense into her, and bring her back to Earth because Wyldkynd does not want any other humans on Heartha besides himself.￼

“Wait a minute,” you say. “Are you telling me that you’re absolutely certain that Adriana is already on Heartha?”￼

“Based on all I’ve observed,” Abrams replies, “there is no other place she could be. Now, as I was saying, once you return to Earth with Adriana, one or both of you will get Wyldkynd to Heartha as planned. Of course, to do all that, you will have to find out how to return to Earth without a complex psionic machine like the portal Adriana and I built here in the lab. That shouldn’t be too hard for you to do. Just find out how the unicorn manages to get to Earth and use his method.”￼

“Are you crazy!” you exclaim. “You want me to travel to another universe without a way to get back to Earth except your blithe assurance that I can figure out a way to return after I get there? And I’m supposed to talk some hostile, albeit attractive, woman into coming back with me?”￼

Abrams pulls back from you and blinks his eyes a few times. “Well, when you say it like that, it does sound a bit dicey. Does that mean you won’t do it?”￼

“Oh I’ll do it,” you reply. “I don’t want to go back to flipping burgers, and it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done something insane just to meet a beautiful woman.”￼

Abrams slaps you on the back. “That’s the spirit!” he says with enthusiasm. “I thought I could count on you.” He waves his hand in the direction of the arch. “Now, let’s get started on getting that portal up and running again.” ￼

> NORTH, NORTH, NORTH
Mud Room
This small room is paved in natural stone. The laboratory interior lies to the south, and there is a door to the north. It is currently tightly shut.  It has a sign on it that says: ￼

EMERGENCY EXIT
    (Push To Open)￼

You push on the door and it swings open to allow you to walk outside. By design, it remains open behind you after you exit the dome.￼

Emergency Exit
This clearing behind the laboratory is a large oval about twenty feet in diameter. There is a path leading southwest around the side of the dome through the dense forest, and a steep trail leads north down the face of a bluff. The emergency exit for the laboratory dome is to the south. It is currently wide open.￼
￼

Leeward Cove (Mid)
The beach here stretches east and west. A light mist turns all distant objects into gray silhouettes. To the west, the gray outline of a rocky ridge extends out into the water of the cove to make a natural causeway. To the east, the dark outline of a dense forest marks the end of the sand. To the south, a good path slopes steeply upward to the laboratory. ￼

The bugs that rose up when you stepped onto the sand look hungry and ready to bite. You wave them away, but they return almost immediately. Suddenly, there is a flash of iridescent wings as the fairy emerges from the trail behind you. As soon as she is over the open sand, she starts swooping and diving as she flies here and there over the beach. At first you think that she is simply cavorting aimlessly, but then you realize that she is hunting the bugs.￼

She chases them down in the air one at a time. When she catches up to one of them, she zaps it with a tiny spark from her fingertips. The stunned bug starts to fall to the earth, but she snatches it up and eats it as she races off after another bug. The bugs start fleeing in panic, with the fairy in hot pursuit. She glances at you from time to time as she chases them as if she is keeping an eye on you. ￼

To the north, you can see debris floating out to sea. ￼

A scale from a large fish or fish-like creature is here. ￼

Forest fairy is following you.￼

> GET SCALE
As you pick the scale up you realize that it feels exceedingly fragile, as it the slightest mishandling would break it into a thousand pieces. But you are careful with it and nothing goes amiss.￼

> EAST, SE
You trudge through the soft sand to the east end of the beach.￼

Leeward Cove (East)
Here at the east end of the cove, the beach stretches to the west where your view is obscured by a light mist. There is a dense forest to the east that would prevent travel in that direction, but there is some indication that there is a break or gap that might be a path directly to the southeast. ￼

A round glass float is here. ￼

Forest fairy is following you.￼

You find that a driftwood stump blocks a path leading southeast into the forest.￼

> GET STUMP, DROP STUMP
The stump proves to be easier to carry than it looks.￼

You carry the stump over to the edge of the sand where it won’t block the trail going southeast and drop it there.￼

> SE
The fairy waves goodbye and flies away on personal business.￼

Dark Forest (North)
The branches of the trees on each side of the path meet overhead to almost blot out the sunlight entirely, leaving the path in a perpetual twilight. All is silent. Through the gloom, you see that the path leads northwest and south. ￼

A feather is here.￼

> GET FEATHER
(the bird feather) Taken.￼

Leeward Cove (East)
Here at the east end of the cove, the beach stretches to the west where your view is obscured by a light mist. There is a dense forest to the east that would prevent travel in that direction, but there is some indication that there is a break or gap that might be a path directly to the southeast. However, someone has disturbed the undergrowth and you can see that there actually is a narrow path leading southeast through the forest. ￼

A round glass float is here. ￼

A large driftwood stump is here.￼

Leeward Cove (Mid)
The beach here stretches east and west. A light mist turns all distant objects into gray silhouettes. To the west, the gray outline of a rocky ridge extends out into the water of the cove to make a natural causeway. To the east, the dark outline of a dense forest marks the end of the sand. To the south, a good path slopes steeply upward to the laboratory. ￼

To the north, you can see debris floating out to sea. ￼

Forest fairy is following you.￼

You trudge through the soft sand to the west end of the beach.￼

Leeward Cove (West)
Here at the west end of the beach, the rocky ridge to the west is close at hand. A rough path leads west up to the top of the ridge, while the beach stretches to the east where the mist obscures your view. ￼

A small, tangled pile of seaweed that has been washed up onto the sand by the action of wave and tide is here. ￼

A clamshell is here. ￼

Forest fairy is following you.￼

> GET SEAWEED
(the seaweed) Taken.￼

> WEST
You climb up to the top of the rocky ridge.￼

Rocky Ridge
The ridge sticks up from the edge of the beach like the spine of some gigantic dead creature. The ridge slopes gently downward to the north to become a rocky causeway out in the water. The large rocks that look like gigantic vertebra have enough dirt and gravel between them to make a path along the top of the ridge. A dense forest to the south, west, northwest, southwest blocks travel in those directions, but you can go down, or east from here to reach the beach. The path along the top of the ridge leads north out onto the causeway, but there is a crevasse across the path just to the north of where you are standing. ￼

To the north, out on the causeway, it looks like there are one or more objects that look intriguing. ￼

Forest fairy is following you.￼

> DROP STUMP
You take careful aim and drop the stump into the crevasse where it lodges upside down to make a handy step leading across the gap. The fairy hovers over the crevasse, glances down at the stump, and gives you a round of applause with her tiny hands. Then she gives you a little mock bow and flies away to the southeast.￼

> NORTH
You nimbly step onto the stump you placed in the crevasse and cross to the other side.￼

Rocky Causeway
A narrow rock causeway running a short distance out into the water. The currents in the cove have washed sand and gravel up into the rocks to make for smooth walking. The causeway rises out of the water to the south to become a rocky ridge. There is a crevasse that blocks the way south. However, the stump you placed there allows easy passage. ￼

A soggy small box is here. ￼

A soggy green box is here. ￼

A cigarette lighter is here. ￼

A charcoal briquette is here.￼

> X SMALL BOX, GET SHORT BEAD
While the box is wet and soggy, it doesn’t look like it was in the water very long. The printing on the box is still legible and it says: FERRITE BEADS. A look inside reveals that the small box contains a short ferrite bead and a long ferrite bead.￼

To the north, out on the causeway, it looks like there are one or more objects that look intriguing.￼

You scramble down the rocky slope.￼

￼

Emergency Exit
This clearing behind the laboratory is a large oval about twenty feet in diameter. There is a path leading southwest around the side of the dome through the dense forest, and a steep trail leads north down the face of a bluff. The emergency exit for the laboratory dome is to the south. It is currently wide open.￼

This small room is paved in natural stone. The laboratory interior lies to the south, and there is a door to the north. It is currently wide open.  It has a sign on it that says: ￼

EMERGENCY EXIT
    (Push To Open)￼
￼

Laboratory
The circular laboratory occupies most of the dome’s interior. A large steel arch stands in the middle of the laboratory. It has a control panel mounted on the front of its right leg. A copper-clad table is attached to the leg below the control panel. A copper box sits on top of the table. An elaborate wire web spans the opening of the arch from top to bottom and from left to right. The exits and entrances to other rooms are around the perimeter of the laboratory. The laboratory entry is to the south; the mud room is to the north; the storage room is to the northwest; the lab assistant’s room is to the east; and Abrams’ room is to the northeast.￼

A standard office wastebasket is here. A laboratory notebook is here. A length of rope is here. ￼

Abrams stands off to one side of the arch staring at it. He seems lost in thought.￼

> X PORTAL
The arch is made from heavy sheet steel painted flat black. It is easily tall enough for a man to walk upright under it. At the footings, the legs of the arch are about three feet square. They taper as they rise so that they are only about a foot square at the apex. There is a touch-sensitive control panel mounted on the right leg of the arch at eye level. A copper box sits on a table that is attached to the right arch leg directly below the control panel. A copper-wire web hangs under the arch blocking its opening. ￼

The words on the arch’s control panel are in red letters that say:￼

————————————— 
     OFF
(Touch Control Panel for ON)
—————————————￼

> TOUCH PANEL
￼
The display flashes for a few moments. Then green words appear that say:￼

————————————— 
     ON
(Touch Control Panel for OFF)
————————————— ￼

A strange feeling comes over you. It begins with something that feels like touch of a feather on the base of your tail bone. The feather touch sweeps upwards rapidly, following your spine until it reaches the base of your skull. Then it changes into something that feels like a furry head band across your forehead and around the back of your head. After a moment, that feeling vanishes to be replaced by a tingling in the center of your forehead. That feeling waxes to the point where it feels uncomfortable, then it wanes until you no longer feel it. ￼

You are a little awed by the experience. You glance over at Abrams and he nods his head and smiles.￼

“I take it that this is the first time you’ve activated a powerful psionic machine,” he says. “Ordinary people don’t feel it, by the way, even those with some degree of psychic ability. You have to have psionic talent along with your other psychic abilities. And, judging by the look on your face, you have that talent in abundance just like Adriana. I am a little envious. I feel it too, but it’s just barely perceptible to me. I can only imagine what you must have felt. Of course, that’s why I hired you. Ordinary people can’t even operate the portal’s eloptic analyzer, but for you, all it will take is your touch on the copper table or just being near the portal when it’s initially powered on.” ￼

The analyzer display screen goes blank for a moment, then it displays:

Abrams steps up and looks over your shoulder at the display. “Interesting, eh?” he says. “You’ve got your work cut out for you Nick. Adriana spent days analyzing things, and writing down the readings. Then she spent several more days trying out objects in the web. She found a clue that helped her solve the problem, but she never told me what it was.” ￼

The web lights up with sporadic, weak flashes of energy. The diary is clearly visible in the central circle.￼

Abrams walks over and stands next to you. “Good to see you’re working on getting the web to resonate.” ￼

The web has a brilliant, nimbus that extends outwards for about six feet. The center of your forehead feels like someone is pressing their thumb against it. You can no longer see the dream journal in the central circle. Instead, the circle has become a window looking down at the surface of a sea from a high vantage point. ￼

Abrams walks rapidly over to the arch and looks at the glowing web.￼

“You’ve done it my boy! “ he shouts. “The web is tuned. When Adriana got that to happen, all she did was enter the arch and then she vanished from the face of the Earth.” ￼

> ENTER PORTAL
As you walk through the arch, the web feels insubstantial, more like an ancient cobweb than the copper wire your logical mind assures you is there. It caresses your face as you pass through it.￼

Suddenly you are surrounded by a harsh golden glare and you find yourself plummeting downwards. Your arms and legs feel heavy and numb. You try to cry out, but your voice comes out as an inarticulate moan that goes on and on, seemingly without end.￼

Down...￼

The numbness spreads to your entire body. You don’t feel the wind of your passage. You lose everything you are carrying. ￼

Down...￼

The harsh golden light becomes softer, muted, and gentle on your eyes. ￼

Down...￼

Your thoughts become slow, and muted. You find a deep, lazy peace while falling from the sky.￼

Down...￼

You hit the surface of the water with a mighty splash. Feeling nothing, thinking nothing, you sink down beneath the water. A surge of panic washes through you. You try to swim to the surface, but you can only feebly wave your arms and legs. It is barely enough to keep you vertical as your natural buoyancy causes you to rise.￼

When your head breaks free of the water, you begin to breath deeply. At first, the air smells spicy, alien, but then something in your sluggish mind shifts and it smells incredibly clean and pure. With the next few breaths, your thoughts speed up and you begin thinking clearly again.￼

Your body is still firmly within the grip of the strange lethargy, but your mind is filled with excitement. You turn around a full circle in the water to get your first look at an alien world. Heartha! You’ve made it to Heartha!￼

Open Sea
You are floating in a warm sea. About 200 yards to the south, a large flat rock sticks up out of the water in the middle of what appears to be a small cove. The cove has a sandy beach at the foot of a ridge that rises up from a large land mass. You see a shape on the rock that makes it look like a woman is sitting there. ￼

The lethargy that grips your body seems to be getting worse. It’s now verging on paralysis. You manage to keep your head out of the water, but just barely. It’s difficult to breath without drawing in some water along with the air. ￼

The current seems to be carrying you south towards the rock. ￼

You drift with the current.￼

Time passes...￼

> WAIT, WAIT
You drift with the current.￼

Time passes...￼

Open Sea
You try to take another breath but some water gets in with the air and you begin to choke. You cough up some water and try to draw in more air, but now your neck is paralyzed and you cannot keep your face out of the water. You sink completely below the surface of the water. ￼

You begin to see black spots swarming at the edges of your vision. They close in. You lose all sensation in your body and it feels like you are a disembodied consciousness floating in darkness. Then, against all logic, you hear a contralto voice speaking in the cadences of a foreign language. It rapidly becomes louder until it sounds like the sea itself is speaking to you. You feel a sudden shift in your mind and you can understand the words.￼

“Be at peace man-of-Earth, for I am with you,” the sea’s voice says with surprising gentleness for something so huge. ￼

You see a flash of pleasant, pale blue light in the darkness that surrounds you, and then you slip into a peaceful sleep. ￼

You drift with the current.￼

Time passes...￼

You drift with the current.￼

Time passes...￼

Open Sea
￼
You drift with the current.￼

Time passes...￼

Somewhere
You open your eyes to normal daylight. You realize that you are lying on your back staring upwards at a pale lavender sky. You get the impression that time has passed since you sank beneath the surface of the water, but you cannot say how long. You are unable to move except to blink.￼

> BLINK
￼
You blink your eyes.￼

Somewhere
A woman’s face comes into view, blocking out the sky. Her pale green skin is smooth and glows with vitality. Her eyes are a liquid brown and resemble the eyes of harbor seal. They give her face a mournful beauty. Her nose is small, almost dainty, and her nostrils appear to have the capability to close and open at will. Her eyebrows are coarse, like the whiskers of a cat. They sweep upward and back giving her face an exotic streamlined look. Her mouth and lips are of normal size and shape. She smiles down at you and opens her mouth to speak. She exposes a double row of needle-like teeth and you realize that any resemblance to a human female is completely superficial. ￼

“Greetings,” she says in a melodic voice. “The paralysis will end as soon as Heartha’s Hands have completed the first phase of transforming your physical body. They have already completed the first phase of transforming your mental body, which is why you can understand my speech. But enough of that for now. You must be exhausted from the trials of your journey.”￼

You hear some rustling sounds as if she is doing something with her hands out of the range of your vision.￼

“Sleep,” she says softly. You see a flash of pale blue light, and you immediately relax and fall asleep.￼

> WAIT
￼
Time passes...￼

Mermaid Rock
You wake up to find that the paralysis that had gripped you earlier has gone. You sit up and see that you are on a rock in the middle of a cove. A mermaid is sitting in front of you. She gives you a smile that exposes needle-like teeth.￼

“You seem to be feeling better, man-of-Earth,” she says. “I am Axia of the Merfolk, and it is I who pulled you from the sea.”￼

Feeling a little dazed, you lift first one arm, then the other to find that you can move them normally. Axia nods her head in sympathy. ￼

“Your paralysis must have been a terrible ordeal for you, but you may take comfort in knowing that living beings fare far better than dead things. If you look at your clothing, which is not alive, you will see what I mean. Oh, and if you had anything made of metal with you, don’t worry about losing it. The metallic elements of Earth cannot exist here in their earthly forms, so the thing is useless by now, and likely unrecognizable.” ￼

A dark shape beneath the surface of the water patrols the area around the rock. ￼

Axia is here.￼

> TT AXIA, T EARTH WOMAN
 “Thanks for rescuing me. My name is Nick Wayne and I’m a little dazed by all that’s happened to me since I arrived on Heartha. I came here to find an earth woman, and I need to find out what’s going on,” you say to Axia.￼

“I desire to help,” she replies. “What do you wish to talk about?” 

– (topics) – 
    Axia 
    Earth woman ￼

– (advice/hint) – 
    Advice 
    Hint￼

 “I came to Heartha to find an earth woman named Adriana,” you say to Axia. “Do you have any idea where she could be?”￼

“No, I don’t,” Axia replies. “However, I did meet a young Merfolk hunter who pulled an earth woman from the waters of this cove a few years ago. He helped her much as I’ve helped you. Like most of the young Merfolk males, his desire to mate overwhelms his intellect in the presence of an attractive female leaving him besotted and witless. But he possesses enough psychic power to use magic, and he managed to find enough brains to figure out how to use his magic to save her life.￼

Then, in an act of total foolishness, he concocted a story that made her believe that he transformed into a man with legs every other year and that she could restore Balance by having an intimate relationship with him. It was all a fantasy in his mind, and being young and male, he likely believed his own story. To complete his beguiling of her, he gave her his Magic Theory book, Spell List, and magic talisman.￼

Anyway, apparently his efforts bore fruit. He says that she told him that she would set up camp nearby and wait a year for him to transform. Of course, he never showed up for their rendezvous, and she is likely long gone from the area by now. If I were you, I’d head up to the top of the hill to the south and take a good look around.” ￼

> SOUTH
 “Wait!” Axia cries out as she points to the dark shape beneath the surface of the water that is now rapidly approaching the rock. ￼

A moment later, the dark shape stops right next to the edge of the rock where you are sitting. A pronounced wave of sympathy for the poor hungry thing washes through you. You feel like you should sacrifice yourself to satisfy its need. You lend forward in preparation for jumping into the water, but at the last minute you come to your senses and you draw back.￼

“Good for you,” Axia says. “That sharazz is a powerful predator and the Law of Empathy works in its favor. You are safe up here on this rock, but if you had actually jumped into the water, it would be a different story. I should have warned you earlier, but I guess I forgot that you are ignorant of all things Heartha. Fortunately, you are not in the belly of the beast, and I have an opportunity to tell you about Heartha predators, if you’re the type of person who likes to acquire knowledge for its own sake.” ￼

She suddenly stops talking and gets a blank look on her face. She stares off into space for a moment, then looks you in the eye.￼

“Mother Heartha just spoke to me,” she says with reverence. “It seems that it’s important for me to tell you about Heartha magic.”￼

The dark shape continues to patrol the waters near the rock.￼

> T MAGIC
 “You mean to say that magic works on Heartha?” you ask.￼

“Yes,” she replies, “although it doesn’t work like the magic in the fantasies of Earth.￼

If someone has enough psychic power, and is carrying a particular talisman, he or she can cast a spell. Everyone in the priesthood of any race has such power and wields the various spells to benefit all.￼

“I believe that you possess more than enough psychic power to work magic, and Mother Heartha seems to wish you to do so. Therefore, I shall give you my beginner’s Magic Theory Book, Spell List, and talisman so that you may begin. All you really need is the Spell List and the talisman. The Magic Theory Book is optional reading that you might find interesting if you have the time to read it. You shouldn’t have any trouble getting started.”￼

She reaches behind her and gets a few items from a recess in the rock and hands them to you.￼

“But now you won’t be able to work magic,” you protest as you receive the items.￼

“Do not fret on my account,” she replies. “Eventually, I will return home and replace my magic tools. I do not need magic out here on this rock. I can hunt for my food just like any other Heartha predator. I won’t be able to catch any land crabs without magic because I can’t move around on land fast enough to get close enough to them to use Empathy. The land crabs are my favorite food, but it won’t hurt me to do without them for a while.” ￼

The dark shape stops moving and sinks out of sight.￼

> SOUTH
You swim to the sandy beach.￼

Crab Beach
The beach at this small cove is only about fifty yards wide. The rocks at the west end of the sandy area present a formidable barrier to travel in that direction. A dense forest comes right down to the edge of the sand to the south. Off to the north, you can see a large, flat rock sticking up from the sea a short swim away. A mermaid is sitting on the flat rock. A cave entrance is to the east, and a path leads into the forest to the south. ￼

There are several large crab-like creatures on the sandy beach when you step out of the water and onto the sand. They immediately scuttle away to hide in the rocks. As you watch the crabs hide, you remember that Axia loves to eat them and you are suddenly filled with a strong desire to bring a crab to her. Now where did that desire come from? You never used to have any sense of urgency about keeping things even. ￼

Lost in thought, you remain still for a few moments to get your feelings sorted out. A crab comes out of hiding. It begins to roam the beach looking for anything edible that has washed up onto the sand. Now that was a bit of luck. ￼

A crab is here.￼

> C BIND

A tangle of seaweed washes up on the beach. The crab wanders over to investigate and becomes entangled. It begins to methodically cut one strand of seaweed after another with its claws as it works to free itself.￼

The crab settles into the seaweed tangle and becomes motionless.￼

> GET CRAB
Being careful to not wake the creature, you gently untangle the crab and pick it up. You kick the seaweed into the water and it sinks out of sight.￼

> NORTH, GIVE CRAB TO AXIA
You swim out to the mermaid’s rock and climb out of the water to sit in front of her.￼

Mermaid Rock
This rock sticks up from the waters of a small cove to make a platform that is about ten feet in diameter. It is littered with fish skeletons and shells of various kinds. Underneath the debris, it is white with bird droppings. It is surrounded by open sea except to the south where you can see a sandy beach a short swim away. ￼

“Greetings, Nick Wayne,” Axia says warmly. ￼

Axia is here.￼

Axia accepts the crab and roughly places it on the rock in front of her. The crab wakes up and she stares down at it intently. It raises its claws in a defensive posture and turns to face her. Her liquid brown eyes shine with excited anticipation.￼

Though her gaze is not directed at you, you still feel a wave of intense longing and hunger wash over you that you ignore with great difficulty. The crab immediately becomes passive and lowers its claws. Axia snatches it up and slams it down on the rock with one smooth motion to kill it instantly. She then tears the shell open and devours its white flesh with her needle-like teeth.￼

“Thank you Nick,” she says when she is finished eating. “I thought that I would have to go without eating crab for many days. Your gift might not have seemed like much, but your intent was immaculate, so Balance has been restored between us.” ￼

A mermaid is sitting on the flat rock. A cave entrance is to the east, and a path leads into the forest to the south. ￼

While the sand of the beach is covered with the marks made by the crabs, the crabs that made them are nowhere in sight.￼

Beach Cave
The walls of the cave are gray stone with black veins that resemble the blood vessels of a living creature. The floor of the cave is sand. While some of the light comes from the glowing fungus on the walls and ceiling, most of the light comes from the west where the entrance to the cave lies, and from the east where an unseen light source is slowly pulsing with a soft radiance. ￼

A beautiful, black flower is growing from the junction of two large, black veins in one of the walls of the cave.￼

Sea Grotto
This grotto is about ten feet in diameter, and the vaulted ceiling is about eight feet above your head. The walls and ceiling are festooned with clumps of glowing fungus, but the main illumination comes from a pool in the center of the grotto. A soft, pure white light emanates from the depths of the pool. The light slowly waxes and wanes in a long, slow rhythm. The sand around the edge of the pool is a darker color than the floor. The exit is to the west. 

As you enter the grotto, you feel an intense pain in your knees and a feeling of melancholy washes over you. A young merman is lying on the sand at the edge of the pool. The sand next to his lower body at about knee height is the same darker color as the sand around the edge of the pool. ￼

“Mother Heartha be praised,” the merman says. “Just when I thought that I was to pay the ultimate price for my foolishness, She brought someone who can help me.” ￼

> T WHAT
 “How did this happen to you?”￼

“It’s a long story but I’ll try to be brief for both our sakes. You see before you a man who is in dire straits because of a woman, an alien such as yourself. She fell from the sky a few years ago. I saved her from drowning and kept her safe while the Hands of Heartha worked on her. Her beauty and gifted mind soon won my heart. Her name, Adriana, became a soft refrain in the back of my mind. Much to my delight, I found that she felt the same way about me.￼

However, we regretfully realized that we could not have any kind of intimate relationship because of the differences in our bodies. In a besotted moment, I told her that I grew legs and walked upon land as a man every other year. I gave her my magic talisman and Spell List to help her survive on Heartha without me, and she went off to create a camp where she could live while she waited for me to come to her as a man. She said that she would mark the path so I could find her camp. As soon as she was gone, I wasted no time in trying my crazy scheme  to transform myself into a man.” ￼

> T SCHEME
 “What crazy scheme could have any chance of transforming you into a man?” you ask. ￼

“Good question,” he replies. “I knew that there have been humans in the distant past who came to Heartha and Heartha’s Hands transformed them into Merfolk. And, I knew that we Merfolk have leg bones and a pelvis in our skeletons. So I reasoned that the reverse could happen, provided Mother Heartha was willing to help. I also knew that one of Mother Heartha’s sacred pools was located in this grotto. These pools are a direct conduit to the heart of Heartha, and to the mind of the Mother. I felt that if I could come to this pool, She would feel my need and help me.￼

So I started coming to this grotto almost daily to commune with Mother Heartha and fantasize on a life with the woman I love. I’ve continued doing it for a few years now, never giving up hope. Up until a few days ago, I just came to the pool and lay next to it for a few minutes and concentrated on my feelings for Adriana. I felt the presence of Mother Heartha each time, and drew some comfort from that, but I wanted more. I wanted legs.￼

About a week ago, I started swing-stepping around and around of the edge of the pool and singing pitiful laments to Mother Heartha with all my heart. I fell into a trance and lost all sense of the passing of time. I didn’t realize what was happening to my knees until the pain brought me to my senses. I’ve been lying here for several days now, unable to return to the sea. Fortunately, the primal water in the pool provides some nourishment, but it is not enough, and I am slowly dying. But there is a way that you could aid me. It would restore Balance if you did, so we would both benefit.” ￼

> T AID
 “How can I aid you?” you ask.￼

“Please, I must get to the sea where the regenerative power of my Merfolk body is the greatest, but the pain has become too great for me to swing-step on dry land anymore. If you could figure out how to protect my knees from the abrasive sand, I can swing-step to the water in the cove on my own.” ￼

Hilltop Trail
Once past the dense growth at the edge of the forest, the trail gets fairly easy to follow as it leads upward towards a hilltop. A gigantic boulder the size of a house has rolled down from the hill top and come to rest on the trail to the south. Fortunately, the boulder broke into two halves when it crashed down onto the trail. The cleft between the two halves is wide enough to permit foot travel. A side trail leads west from here, while the main trail leads north to the beach, and south through the cleft. ￼

A very large man is sitting cross-legged in the rock cleft and completely blocking the trail to the south. He is sorting through several small objects on the ground in front of him. At your approach, he gathers them up and puts them into a pouch that is hanging around his neck. He clutches the pouch to his chest as if to guard it, and extends his other hand in mute appeal.￼

Dark Forest
The forest canopy here blocks enough sunlight to keep the trail in deep shadow. The widely-spaced, black tree trunks look like columns in an ancient temple. Tattered moss curtains hang down from the canopy giving this place the look of a long-abandoned great hall. Dank undergrowth grows along both sides of the trail. The trail itself leads deeper into the dark forest to the west, and to the Hilltop Trail to the east. ￼

Among the lustrous leaves, you notice a few unopened flower buds. You walk around to the far side of the bush and see one fully opened blue flower hanging there in easy reach. It is similar in size and shape to an earthly rose. Its electric-blue petals shine with reflected sunlight. Just seeing it here makes you feel peaceful and relaxed. A trail leads east from here.￼

“I have something to give you that will restore the Balance between us.”￼

You walk over to Aerrowan and he pulls a black pearl from a pouch on his utility belt and hands it to you. “I give you this black pearl. May it restore Balance between us.”￼

He then hands you a blue pearl. “No doubt Adriana has long ago abandoned all hope of seeing me again. Should you encounter her in your travels, please give her this blue pearl and tell her that I ask her to forgive me for the pain I caused her. I know that it won’t make up for what I did, but I honestly thought the power of my love would be enough to change my nature and allow me to come to her as a man. I was a fool.

The rocky trail passes through a narrow cleft in a gigantic boulder at this point. The nearly vertical sides rise on both sides to a height of about 15 feet. The rocky trail between the two sides leads north and south. ￼

You notice that something has been scratched into the rock on the side of the cleft.￼
￼

Hill Top
There are a few widely-spaced boulders scattered around in this large clearing. The view is quite good up here. ￼

To the north you can see the mermaid’s rock out in the center of the small cove. The land crabs appear like tiny specks moving around on the cove’s white beach. To the east you see a forest that stretches to the horizon. The rocks get closer together and smaller on the south side of the clearing where they become a rockslide. An extensive swampy area begins at the foot of the rockslide. South of the rockslide, a colossal tree rises up from an island in the middle of the swamp. Far to the south, beyond the tree, you see a tall mountain whose upper reaches are shrouded in clouds. The path to the south is now blocked by the rockslide, however there is a trail that goes east and another one that goes north. ￼

As you enter the clearing at the hilltop, you see some man-sized creatures wandering around looking into crevices and turning some of the smaller rocks over to look under them. One of the creatures sits on a large rock supervising them.￼

“Hey!” he cries in astonishment and points at you.￼

The others stop their work to look at you. The one sitting on the rock stands up.￼

“By the rocks! Look at that,” he cries. “Another Earth-creature walks the good soil of Heartha! It’s a man this time.”￼

He looks back at the others and glares at them. “You dhiggers get back to work. I’ll deal with the earth-creature.”￼

As you stand there staring at him, he waddles over to you. He pushes his face up close to yours and squints. He sniffs the air a few times, then he pulls back and looks you in the eye.￼

“I go by Lpkac above ground,” he tells you, with a clicking sound in the middle of his name. “But you may call me ‘engineer’ if it is easier for you to say.”￼

He gives you a hard stare. “You stay away from my dhiggers,” he says. “They aren’t smart enough to carry on a conversation. You start talking to them like that other earth creature did and you’ll just interfere with their work.”￼

He turns away from you and returns to sit on his rock.￼

 “What are you doing here and how can I help?” you ask.￼

“Two weeks ago, I set out with a pack of dhiggers to find some faldspar crystals, which our dhigger infants require to grow good digging claws,” Lpkac replies. “Since this hill top always has an abundance of them, I came here first. Shortly after we arrived, the rockslide shifted and blocked the trail, but that’s not a big problem. My diggers will dig a tunnel under the rockslide when I’ve found a goodly amount of crystals. I’m in no hurry since we are finding plenty of roots and grubs in among the rocks to eat. But the crystals are another matter. I’m starting to think that we’ve gathered almost all the faldspar crystals here. We’ve found enough of the brown ones, and some of the green, but I need at least one more large green crystal.” ￼

***ATTRACT*** ￼

For a minute or so, nothings seems to happen. Then an arboreal rodent having a long bushy tail scampers into the clearing from the trail that leads down to the rock cleft. It pauses at the edge of the clearing and sits upright on its hind legs like a dog. It is carrying a small green crystal. It looks around at each of the people in the clearing before staring intently at you. It darts over and drops the crystal at your feet. When you bend down and pick the crystal up, the rodent scampers back down the trail and disappears from sight.￼

Much to your surprise, the small crystal vibrates and merges with the medium crystal to make one large crystal.￼

 “Hey! That’s exactly what we’re looking for,” he says as he takes it from you. “I owe you one.” ￼

After Lpkac puts the crystal into one of the pockets of his work apron, he stands up abruptly and claps his hands together loudly. The dhiggers immediately come to attention and stare at him. He makes a series of hand signals and they start digging a ramp down into the dirt at the base of the rock slide A few minutes later, they begin digging a tunnel at the end of the ramp. Periodically, one of the dhiggers pushes dirt out of the tunnel to make a rapidly growing pile to one side of the ramp. ￼

After about ten minutes, no more dirt is pushed out of the tunnel. Lpkac stands up and waves goodbye as he enters the tunnel. He is gone from view a moment later.￼

> ENTER TUNNEL
￼
As you walk through the tunnel you realize that it is dimly lit and ventilated by an irregular row of holes in the ceiling that have been dug upward to the surface. Your respect for dhigger engineering goes up a notch.￼

The tunnel goes on for quite a distance. Even with the dim light and the ventilation, you start to feel vaguely claustrophobic.￼

You start to walk faster.￼

Finally you see light at the end of the tunnel.￼

You sprint the last dozen yards and burst into a sunlit area.￼

Snorter Wallows
A few dozen huge naked men are wallowing in pits scattered around a steaming mudflat. They are twice as large as the biggest men of Earth, and their noses are disproportionately larger than the Earth norm. They are all snorting loudly through their large noses and sighing with contentment. Their collective din is quite loud.￼

A pavilion has been set up at the edge of the mudflat near you. A large woman swaddled in a brightly colored moo moo dress sits on the back of a big man who is down on all fours beneath the pavilion. She is surrounded by several chests. About six of the diaper-wearing beggars stand around feeding her fruit and nuts from mounds piled on large tables on each side of the pavilion. She is watching the activity around her with lazy interest. ￼

There is a tunnel to the north that leads under a rockslide, a wide path into the forest to the west, and a muddy trail to the south that leads through the mudflat avoiding the open pits. It ends on the far side of the mudflat where a colossal tree stands reaching towards the sky. ￼

“Greetings!” the woman says to you in a soft, deep purr. “You look to be a total stranger, alien in fact. But you are male, and all men are welcome here, be they of Heartha or otherwise. I am Edena, Mother to this tribe of Mud Folk.”￼

Then she looks down at the man whose back is serving as her chair. “And this besotted fool is Jharry.” ￼

Edena is here. ￼

Jharry is here.￼

 “Pleased to meet you Edena,” you say. “I’m Nick Wayne of Earth. I really need to talk to you.”￼

 “I am looking for an earth woman who came to Heartha a few years ago,” you tell Edena. “Have you seen her?”￼

“Yes, a female creature from Earth did pass through here,” Edena replies. “She was a pretty little thing. I don’t like having females around my sons, be they pretty or ugly, but she was too small to arouse much interest, so I tolerated her presence. I am sorry that I did because she caused a lot of trouble.” ￼

“Trouble? What kind of trouble?” you ask.￼

“Well, for one thing, she didn’t understand Balance. She thought that I should help her cross my wallows without first doing something for me. Ha! What a laugh. I told my sons that no one was to help her until I gave the word.￼

Anyway, she started moping and wandering listlessly. After about three days, I noticed that this one I’m sitting on was following her around and doing little things for her. Then, after a few days of that, he suddenly carried her across the wallows.￼

I was astonished. I didn’t think it was possible for my sons to disobey me. Of course, I got angry with him. I’ve been sitting on him ever since. If I let him up for more than a day, he runs off to find Adriana and I have to send some of the men to fetch him. So, I’ll keep sitting on him until he gets her out of his system.” ￼

“You say you want to go find this Earth woman? Well, you cure Jharry of his affliction and I will help. You can talk to him about it if you want to, but don’t talk to the rest of my sons. I want to keep things between the three of us.” ￼

***SEDUCE*** ￼

Jharry’s eyes fly open wide. After looking startled for a moment, he gives you a coy look. “You are a very nice man,” he says softly. “You want to come into the wallows with me?”￼

Edena reaches down and twists one of Jharry’s ears until he cries out in pain.￼

“You imbecile!” she says to him. “Snap out of it before I really hurt you.”￼

She then gives you a hard look.￼

“You are wearing out your welcome, man of Earth. Do not trifle with me!”￼

The men in the wallows fall silent at her tone. They stare at you and shift around in the mud uneasily. They begin to talk quietly among themselves. Every now and then one of them gives you a hard look.￼

> C REPULSE
￼
***REPULSE*** ￼

Jharry looks at you as if seeing you in a new light. His eyes narrow.￼

“Let me up Mother,” he says to Edena. “This man disgusts me and I can’t stand to be near him. And, I no longer have feelings for that woman. I don’t know what was wrong with me; she is much too small to be of interest.” ￼

“Sweet Mother Heartha!” Edena cries. “I do believe you’ve done it, man of Earth.” ￼

She looks at her Beggars and gives them a rapid series of orders punctuated by grunts and snorts. They immediately begin breaking branches off the nearby trees and laying them on top of the mud to make a winding path to the south that avoids the wallow pits. Within a few minutes, the trail is complete. ￼

She stands up and looks down at Jharry. “You may rise, my son. Now go get yourself a good wallowing.”￼

Jharry wastes no time in carrying our her order.￼

Edena waves her hand and four men emerge from the west path carrying a large divan. They put it down under the pavilion and Edena reclines on it.￼

“And you, man of Earth, may go now. I suggest paying the Fairy Queen a visit, but you may do as you wish. You have my blessing.” ￼

> SOUTH
You walk south keeping to the trail made by the branches. The footing is soft, but you can trudge your way forward. You arrive at the far side after ten minutes of trudging to find yourself on the island where the huge tree is growing.￼

Fairy Island
This small island in the swamp has been built up by centuries of leaf fall from a colossal tree that stands at its center. Three fairies hover in the air staring at you with a look of astonishment. As soon as you move to get a better look at them, they fly upward into the branches of the tree and disappear. The newer portions of the island have grown enough to touch the surrounding land in a couple of places. You may climb the tree or go north over the mudflats from here. Also, a natural bridge of well-composted leaves leads south.￼

> CLIMB TREE
Fairy Palace
You are standing on a platform that spans two limbs of the great tree. Many of the small female fairies stand around in groups communicating with hand gestures and mouse-like squeaks, while dozens of others are flitting around above the platform. There are several fairy-sized towers around the edges of the platform, and one large ornate tower in the center. The tree trunk goes both upward and downward from here. ￼

A small throne sits in front of the larger tower and a regal-looking female fairy sits on the throne. Standing, she would be about a 15 inches tall, making her several times as tall as the small female fairies. She is wearing a crown woven from golden-colored strands. She is attired in a white gown made from silk with tiny crystal beads woven into it that sparkle and shine in the sunlight. Four tall, uniformed male fairies holding lances stand at attention behind the throne. ￼

“Welcome, human!” the large fairy calls out to you. “I’m known as Copia, and I am Queen of this Fairy Tree. I have been expecting you to show up ever since Clio returned to us.”￼

Due to her larger size, her voice has a lower pitch than the squeaks of the small fairies. ￼

Copia is here.￼

 “I came to Heartha in search of an earth woman named Adriana. I hope to get her to return to Earth to complete a project that she was hired for,” you tell Copia. “Do you have any idea of where I could find her?”￼

Copia looks at you for a long moment. Then she nods her head as if coming to an agreement with herself.￼

“Yes, an earth woman did come through here. She was greatly troubled and asked that I help her. The nature of her problem was deeply personal and I am not at liberty to discuss it with you. It is somewhat of a moot point anyway, for I was not able to help her with her problem. I advised her to wait until her problem reached a certain level of severity, then seek the help of the High Priest of the Unicorns. She left immediately and headed south where she hoped to find a good place to live, and eventually find help and solace for her problem.” ￼

Copia waves her hand in silent command and a fairy flies out of the large tower and lands next to the queen. The newcomer is a female fairy about half as tall as the Queen.￼

“Allow me to present Clio, the current Virgin Queen,” Copia says with a flourish.￼

There is something very familiar about Clio. For a moment you are at a loss, then you have it. “Have you ever been to Earth?” you ask her.￼

Clio laughs at the expression on your face. Due to the small size of her throat and mouth, her laugh is high-pitched, but it still manages to sound melodic. “Yes, Nick Wayne,” she replies. I am that same forest fairy who helped you free Albert Abrams on Earth and get that big, clumsy portal of his working.” ￼

> UP
Upper Branches
You cling tightly to the trunk of the great tree. Countless gourd-shaped fairy houses hang from the tree branches, and yellow flower buds peek out from leaf clusters here and there. Some of the buds have opened into yellow flowers that fill the air with a foul odor. Hundreds of fairies fly around you as the curious little creatures try to get a better look at you. Despite your great height you cannot see much because the leaves block your view. The trunk continues upwards and downwards from here. ￼

One yellow flower is within easy reach. ￼

She makes three passes then flies off into the swamp. The newer portions of the island have grown enough to touch the surrounding land in a couple of places.

You are standing on a finger of land that stretches out into a lake of fire. The bed of this lake is burnt, blackened rock. Twisted, hollow fingers of rock thrust upwards from the bed. Fire and cinders spurt out of these chimneys at irregular intervals. A network of fissures divides the lake bed into hundreds of small islands. Lava oozes up from the depths of the fissures to create fiery pools. Clouds of smoke and steam float across the lake. A natural stone arch to the south crosses above the lake bed to a narrow strip of rocky land at the base of a great volcanic peak. There is a rock hut to the east of where you are standing. You can go east to enter the hut, south to cross over the stone arch, or north to go to Fairy Island. ￼

You see a huge dark shape moving within the clouds at the summit of the nearby volcano as if some flying creature were circling the mountain top. ￼

Clio is following you.￼

> IN
Rock hut
The interior wall of the rock hut has been plastered with mud. The mud plaster has an odd pattern on its surface. There is a fire pit in the middle of the dome, and a sleeping mat along the far interior wall. There is a small hole in the center of the dome overhead for smoke to escape. The arched entrance opening is to the west. ￼

A pair of well-worn and broken shoes lies next the fire pit. A storage basket is next to the fire pit. ￼

Clio is following you.￼

> X BASKET, X BOWL
This basket is about the size of a laundry basket. It has been woven out of dried red grass that seems to be remarkably flexible and tough. The storage basket contains a clay bowl.￼

The bowl looks like it has been pinched out of raw clay to make a useful container. The exterior looks charred, like it was fired in a wood fire. There is an extraordinary red flower in the bowl.￼

You can go east to enter the hut, south to cross over the stone arch, or north to go to Fairy Island. ￼

You see a formation of three large dark shapes fly out of the clouds at top of the peak and circle around to drop down out of sight on the far side of the mountain. While you didn’t any details, you did get the impression of gigantic wings slowly flapping. ￼

Clio is following you.￼

> SOUTH
The steepness of the arch’s upward rise makes for a difficult climb, but you manage to claw your way up to the top of the arch where the heat and fumes make you dizzy and nauseous. You straddle the arch and hang on for dear life. Fortunately, you do not fall into the fire lake. You eventually recover enough to scoot forward and slide down the far side of the arch where you come to a rough landing.￼

Dragon Island
This island is dominated by a volcanic mountain peak. The only flat land is a black, sandy beach at the base of the mountain. Tall, bright red grass grows in wetlands at one end of the beach. A natural rock arch rises from the beach to soar over the fiery lake bed. You can go north over the stone arch, or you can climb the mountain. ￼

You see a huge dark shape moving within the clouds at the summit of the nearby mountain as if some flying creature were circling the summit.￼

Clio flies over the to the red grass and zaps the first bug she sees. The stunned bug starts to fall, but she catches and eats it before it falls very far. ￼

Clio is following you.￼

> C ATTRACT
￼
***ATTRACT*** ￼

You hear a loud, trumpeting sound from above. A moment later a huge female dragon lands on the sandy beach and gives you a quizzical look. ￼

“I am Kassi, Gate Keeper of the Sacred Grotto. Let me take a look at who has so rudely snagged my attention,” she says in a modulated roar. “It seems to be a tiny morsel not worth the trouble to snap up, and an alien creature, a male this time. At least that’s a small improvement.” ￼

> C SEDUCE
￼
***SEDUCE*** ￼

Kassi looks at you with an odd expression in her eyes. She steps forward and lowers her head until it is at eye level.￼

“I like you,” she purrs with a voice resembling an idling military tank.￼

> TT KASSI
 “Hello Kassi,” you say. “I am Nick Wayne of Earth and I really need your help. Can we please talk?”￼

“Speak when you have figured out what you wish to talk about.”

    Earth woman ￼

    Advice￼

> T EARTH WOMAN
 “I am seeking to know the whereabouts of an earth woman named Adriana. Do you know where she might be?”￼

“She beguiled the dragon Iowa and he carried her to the top of Dragon Peak where I met her. She seemed quite agitated about some problem she was having. She wouldn’t say what the problem was, only that she had to get to the land of the Unicorns. Seeing no harm in it, I told her that she could pass through our Sacred Grotto. She entered the cave and has not been seen again. Iowa has been moping around ever since, but such things don’t last very long with dragons and he seems to be getting over it now. That’s a good thing. I thought I was going to have to bite some sense into him.￼

“If you wish to get to the top of our mountain and follow her, I will carry you there if you first help me with a little project that I’m working on.” ￼

> T LITTLE PROJECT
 “It’s really quite simple my little friend. I require a new Flower Talisman, but I don’t wish to do a favor for the Elves to get one. Instead, I believe I can make my own if I had one each of the four magical flowers. Unfortunately, the flowers grow in places where full-sized people such as I cannot go. However, now that I have a small-sized friend, my problem is easily resolved. When you bring me the flowers, I will carry you to the top of the mountain to restore Balance.” ￼

> GIVE RED FLOWER TO KASSI
 “Ah yes, dear one that is a fine specimen of a redicia flower. It makes a good start for my flower collection.” ￼

> GIVE BLUE FLOWER TO KASSI
 “Thank you my love. That blure flower makes my collection half complete.” ￼

> GIVE YELLOW FLOWER TO KASSI
 “Oh good! You found a yellak flower. Even those clever little Elves can never seem to find enough of them. Now I need just one more flower.”￼

> GIVE BLACK FLOWER TO KASSI
 “You have been a good friend Nick Wayne,” Kassi says as she carefully picks you up in her claws. “That blackhid flower completes my set of magic flowers. Soon all of Heartha will know that a dragon can make a talisman that is as good as any made by the Elves. Now I shall restore Balance by flying you up to the top of Dragon Peak.”￼

Clio grabs onto Kassi’s tail and hangs on for dear life as the dragon lurches upward with powerful strokes of her wings. The ground falls away rapidly as Kassi gains altitude and begins to spiral upward. A few minutes later, you are surrounded by the cloud cover at the top of the mountain. Then, suddenly, Kassi breaks through the clouds and the crater at the top of the mountain is below you. She trumpets loudly and comes in for a surprisingly gentle landing.￼

Dragon Peak
The top of the peak is a crater that is about a half mile wide and a several hundred feet deep. The steep crater wall has been deeply eroded and it has collapsed in a few places. There would be a spectacular view in those places except for the perpetual cloud cover. Dozens of great bowl-shaped nests have been created by carefully stacking volcanic rocks. The nests are currently unoccupied except for sun-bleached bones that provide comfy beds for the dragons. The entrance of a large cave is directly to the east of where you are standing. ￼

After setting you down, Kassi sits down next to the cave.￼

“This cave is the entrance to the sacred Dragon Grotto” she tells you. “The female human you seek was last seen when she entered it. You can enter it now to follow her, or, if you’re not in a hurry to finish your quest, I can tell you a little about the Dragon Grotto before you go.”￼

Clio flies over to the cave entrance and peers into the dark interior for a moment. She looks back at you and shrugs her shoulders. “I can’t see anything from out here.” ￼

> ENTER CAVE
￼
The cave turns to the west as you walk through it. The light from the entrance is gradually replaced by the light from glowing fungus growths. You walk for what seems like an hour before the cave ends in a spacious grotto.￼

Sacred Grotto
This grotto is large enough to accommodate a dragon. There is more of the glowing fungus, but the main illumination comes from what appears to be a circular pool of water in the center of the Grotto floor. A soft, pure white radiance emanates from this pool. It slowly waxes and wanes in a long, slow rhythm. A large cave to the west leads back to Dragon Peak, while the smaller cave to the north appears to lead out of the Grotto into sunlight. ￼

“Who goes there?” asks a human female voice from the shadows.￼

“I am Nick Wayne and this is my fairy companion Clio,” you reply. “You must be Adriana.”￼

“Yes, I am still known as Adriana,” the voice says. “I thought that I recognized you. You’re the man I saw come into the laboratory back on Earth when I was sabotaging the portal. I didn’t think that you could fix the portal, but here you are.” She sighs deeply. It comes out as a sob. “So my plan failed. Now another hapless human is doomed to suffer the same fate as I.”￼

You hear a stirring in the shadows as Adriana hobbles into view. “Behold your future, Nick Wayne,” she says. ￼

The attractive woman whom you saw in the laboratory has been transformed. While the face and neck are still that of Adriana, the rest of her body is that of a horse-like creature that is standing on its hind legs. Her hands and feet are now hooves, and her body is covered with a coat of short white hair. The standing posture is evidently difficult to maintain, for she slowly lowers her upper body until she is standing on all fours. You notice that a stub of a horn is just beginning to emerge from the center of her forehead, and that a short mane is growing out of the back of her neck. ￼

Clio flies over to Adriana and stares at her in astonishment. Then she flies back to hover near your right shoulder. ￼

Adriana is here. ￼

Clio is following you.￼

> TT ADRIANA
 “I’d like to talk to you Adriana,” you say to her when you get over the shock of her appearance.￼

“I am willing,” she replies a bit mournfully. “What do you wish to talk about?” 

– (topics) – 
    what happened ￼

– (advice/hint) – 
    (none)￼

> T WHAT HAPPENED
 “What has happened to you?” you say to her.￼

Adriana shakes her head sadly.￼

“As you no doubt have already learned, in order for us to exist here we humans are transformed into creatures of Heartha by the laws of this universe. As you can see, in the early stages of the transformation we become something monstrous.￼

I came to Heartha thinking I could live in harmony with all creatures and the land itself, which I did. Although I was happy at first, that very happiness led me to become deeply troubled by the possibility of humans following me through the portal and despoiling this paradise world as they have despoiled Earth. So I began building up my Chi so I could project myself to Earth and sabotage the portal. But by the time I had built up enough Chi, I realized that I had it backwards. I didn’t need to protect Heartha from humans; I needed to protect humans from Heartha.￼

I projected to Earth and sabotaged the portal as soon as I was able. I didn’t think that Abrams was going to be able to find anyone with enough psionic talent to repair the damned thing. Of course I feel bad about Wyldkynd and how I ruined his dream of coming to Heartha, but I had a good reason for doing what I did.”￼

“But you looked like a normal human when I saw you in the laboratory sabotaging the portal,” you say to her.￼

“That’s because an astral projection looks like the person’s internal self-image, which may or may not match the person’s physical appearance. In my case, it obviously did not.” ￼

> T ABOUT WYLDKYND
 “So what about Wyldkynd?” you ask Adriana. “Will you return to Earth and bring him to Heartha like you were hired to do?”￼

“I cannot return to Earth looking like this,” she says. “I’d end up in a secret government laboratory for studying aliens or something equally horrible. Plus, Sinitar, the High Priest of the Unicorns, says it would take decades for me to transform back into a human on Earth, so I’d be an old lady or dead before I could live a normal life. Besides that, I don’t want Wyldkynd’s transformation on my conscience. If you want to bring him here, talk to me about  his transformation  and I’ll tell you how to do it. As for me, I have to stay here until I have completely turned into a unicorn. I know you’re anxious to get on with your quest, but you can stay a little longer and talk to me about the unicorn transformation  process if you want to.” ￼

> T HIS TRANSFORMATION
 “My psionic ability is not as strong as yours,” you say to Adriana. “Just supposing that I did want to bring Wyldkynd here myself, how would I be able to do it?” ￼

“Maybe you didn’t have enough psionic ability back on Earth, but that was then, this is now. As they like to say here, the Hands of Heartha have been at work. The first thing to be transformed was the seat of your intelligence and your emotions. As a consequence, you quickly felt a greater empathy for all things, and, whether or not you realize it, your psychic abilities became much greater as well. If you now return to Earth, I assure you that you will be able to use the portal to transport Wyldkynd here. Of course, if you want to do that, you’ll have to go to Sinitar  and ask him to show you how to get to Earth using his Sacred Meadow. Unicorns have been doing it for centuries so you shouldn’t have a problem doing it.” ￼

> T SINITAR
 “Just enter that cave to the north and follow your nose. You will soon arrive at the grasslands where the local herd of Unicorns lives. Sinitar will no doubt be there to greet you. He is a High Priest of Mother Heartha, and he says that She told him to be expecting you.”￼

Her gaze is drawn to the pool in the center of the cave. She stares at it for a moment with a faraway look in her eyes. “I do believe that She wishes me to send you on your way Nick. Go now, and may the Mother be with you.” ￼

“Okay Adriana,” you say. “I wish you the best of luck with your new life, but before I go, I have a message and a gift from someone you know. I found Aerrowan lying in a grotto slowly bleeding to death. He was trying to grow legs for you and his efforts had nearly killed him. He told me to tell you that he really loves you, but he just cannot change. He told me to give you this blue pearl to Balance things between you.” ￼

Adriana gazes at the pearl in the palm of your hand with fierce intensity. The stub of the horn growing out of her forehead begins to glow. Then the pearl floats up from the palm of your hand and drifts through the air to land at the edge of the pool in front of Adriana. She stares down at it for a moment.￼

“Thank you Nick,” she says. “This means a lot to me. As soon as my horn grows out, I will have full control of my telekinesis. I will use it to make a shoulder bag for myself and this pearl will be the first thing I put in it.” ￼

> NORTH
You enter the cave and find that while it is too small for a dragon, you can walk upright. It doesn’t take long to come out the far end of the cave and step into sunlight.￼

Grasslands
This small clearing is in front of a cave entrance. The sea of waist-high grass outside the clearing resembles the grasses on Earth but the top of each stalk has a yellow-green tassel with a dark green center that is almost black. The tassels move and sway with the slightest breeze to create rippling patterns that sweep across the grass in complex wave patterns. You can travel north into the grasslands or south into the cave. ￼

A pure white unicorn with a shining gold horn steps out of the grass and into the clearing.￼

“Isn’t he beautiful!” Clio cries.￼

“Greetings Nick Wayne,” the unicorn says. “ I am Sinitar, High Priest to Mother Heartha. I first saw you on Wyldkynd’s Island as you walked along the path leading from the helicopter landing pad to the laboratory. It is good to finally meet you in person. Mother Heartha is very excited by your arrival here. She tells me that we must make haste to get you back to Earth so that you may bring Andrew Wyldkynd here. Just walk north to our sacred meadow when you are ready to go. I will walk along with you and tell you what to do when we get there.￼

Of course, if you have the time, and wish to learn why Wyldkynd must come here, I can talk about Mother Heartha’s evolution.  Also, I can tell you about the unicorn nexus that you are going to use to get to Earth, but talking about all these topics will take time, and you can simply go north now if you are in a hurry.”￼

Clio flies north a short distance and hovers in the air waiting for you to lead the way. ￼

Sinitar is here, waiting for you to act. ￼

Clio is following you.￼

> NORTH
You walk through the tall grass to the north. After a long walk, you end up in a meadow of grass that has been cropped to about ankle height.￼

Sacred Meadow
This clearing in the grasslands seems to have been made and maintained by continuous careful grazing. Its short grass gives it the appearance of a bright green meadow with a trail leading south. There is an oddly shaped rock in the center of the meadow. To your psionic ability, this place has a hauntingly familiar feel to it. It takes you a moment to realize that the entire meadow is filled with an alien energy that makes you feel like you are back on Earth. ￼

Sinitar turns to face you. He gets a serious look in his eyes.￼

“This place is a bridge between the two universes of Heartha and Earth. A man of your great psionic power can simply touch the oddly shaped rock with the intention of traveling to Earth and that expectation shall be met. I’ve done it several times myself and I can assure you that you will be able to do it as well.￼

When you wish to transport Andrew Wyldkynd to Heartha, all you need to do is lead him to the unicorn glade on Earth and then touch the oddly shaped rock that is located there. I shall remain here waiting for your return.”￼

Clio looks at you and nods her head. “I’ll wait here for you too,” she says. “I haven’t seen Sinitar for a long time and I have some catching up to do.” ￼

Sinitar is following you. ￼

Clio is following you.￼

> TOUCH ROCK
You feel the energy shifting in the Sacred Meadow. A moment of vertigo comes and goes and the sunlight changes color in a subtle way that is hard to define. A gray mist surrounds you then clears. You look around you in wonder to find that you are standing in the Unicorn Glade on Earth touching the oddly-shaped rock in its center.￼

Unicorn Glade
This sunlit glade is so vibrant, bright, and colorful that it looks like an astral dream. Wild flowers in a variety of colors are everywhere. Bugs in all shapes and sizes buzz around looking busy. The giant trees that surround the glade give the impression of pillars supporting the dome of blue sky overhead. There is a rock in the center of the glade, and an alien feeling to the place that tickles the back of your mind with little ghostly fingers. There is a path that leads north through the closely cropped grass of the meadow and into the forest. ￼

> NORTH
You make your way to the laboratory as rapidly as possible.￼

Laboratory Interior
The laboratory you remember has transformed into a medical facility. The interior walls have been removed to make a single large room. The portal and all the laboratory equipment has been replaced by a hospital bed and medical equipment. A female nurse is busy taking readings and making adjustments to the equipment. A doctor stands next to the hospital bed. Exits are to the north and south. ￼

An elderly man is lying on the bed. When he sees you enter, his face lights up. Ignoring the doctor’s worried look, he eases himself off the bed and comes forward to meet you.￼

“Nick Wayne, I presume, “ he says as you shake hands. “It is good to finally meet you. Albert has spoken very favorably of you. I am Andrew Wyldkynd, your employer.”￼

“It is a pleasure,” you reply.￼

The smile fades from his face to be replaced by a serious look.￼

“Nick, I don’t have a lot of time left,” he says, “so I’ll cut to the chase. I may die at anytime. Just too old, they tell me. About the only thing keeping me going is my hope that I’ll be able to make it to Heartha and die there. I can take a few minutes and tell you why I must die there, or you can simply take me to Heartha. The choice is yours.” ￼

> NORTH
You lead Wyldkynd to the Unicorn Glade, traveling as rapidly as he is able.￼

Unicorn Glade
This sunlit glade is so vibrant, bright, and colorful that it looks like an astral dream. Wild flowers in a variety of colors are everywhere. Bugs in all shapes and sizes buzz around looking busy. The giant trees that surround the glade give the impression of pillars supporting the dome of blue sky overhead. There is a rock in the center of the glade, and an alien feeling to the place that tickles the back of your mind with little ghostly fingers. There is a path that leads north through the closely cropped grass of the meadow and into the forest. ￼

Andrew is following you.￼

> TOUCH ROCK
You feel the energy shifting. A moment of vertigo comes and goes and the sunlight changes color in a subtle way that is hard to define. A gray mist surrounds you then clears. You are standing in the Sacred Meadow on Heartha, touching the oddly-shaped rock in its center.￼

Sacred Meadow
The Sacred Meadow is unchanged from when you left it. ￼

Wyldkynd takes a look around and sighs deeply.￼

“At last!” he cries. Then he gets a stricken look on his face and clutches his chest. His knees bend and he collapses onto the grass.￼

You hear a sound and turn to see Sinitar step out of the grass and walk over to Wyldkynd. He is followed by an apparition of a beautiful, exotic-looking woman dressed in a flowing cloud of thin material that moves in the breeze as if it were alive. She kneels down in the grass next to Wyldkynd and gently strokes his forehead. His face relaxes as if all his pain is gone. He sighs deeply and gives her a radiant smile.￼

“Welcome to Heartha my dear Andrew,” she says to him.￼

“Mother Heartha,” he whispers reverently. “It has been so long.”￼

“It has been but a moment to me, nothing more Andrew,” she says quietly. “You relax now and go to sleep.”￼

Wyldkynd closes his eyes and gives one great sigh. Then his chest lays still. The woman reaches out and pulls something that looks like mist out of the top of his head. The mist forms itself into a large, egg-shaped cloud that floats in the air. Nothing happens for a few moments, then it forms itself into an apparition of a younger version of Andrew Wyldkynd.￼

He reaches out and takes Mother Heartha’s hands in his. They stare into each other’s eyes and remain motionless for a moment, then they embrace. A nimbus forms around them that rapidly expands outward. You experience a feeling of tingling energy as it sweeps past you.￼

The light in the clearing seems to grow more vibrant, and the colors of all things seems brighter. You feel excited and energized, more alive than ever before in your life. You see those same feelings reflected in Sinitar’s eyes.￼

The couple pulls apart and Mother Heartha turns to Sinitar. Her eyes glow with affection.￼

“Thanks for your help Sinitar,” she tells him. “You have served Us well. By the way, Adriana’s transformation is almost complete. Her mind will be the equal to your unicorn mind with all the same capabilities. I sense a budding attraction between the two of you. I foresee that you will become her mate, and that your offspring will be the part of the next evolutionary step that Heartha’s creatures will experience now that The Father is with us.”￼

Wyldkynd turns to you. “We owe you a debt,” he says. “If you decide to return to Earth, check in with Abrams. He is now the CEO of the foundation that now controls the distribution of my earthly wealth. There is a provision in the foundation’s charter that will ensure that you and your heirs are quite wealthy. Or, you may remain here on Heartha and complete your own transformation.”￼

“My own transformation?” you ask as you pat yourself down and find no obvious change.￼

Mother Heartha smiles at you. “You didn’t check your ears,” she says. “They are becoming pointed. You are going to make a handsome elf Nick Wayne if you decide to remain on Heartha.”￼

You take a moment to mentally review the poverty, pollution, and widespread suffering on Earth. Even with the wealth and power that would be yours if you returned there, could you live as well as you could live on Heartha where you would have almost nothing?￼

“I think I’m going to like being an Elf,” you tell her. ￼
￼
