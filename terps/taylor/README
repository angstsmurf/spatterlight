Introduction

	Taylormade is a basic text only engine for running the later
	Adventure International UK authored games. This is not the
	same as SAGA+ although some games were recoded from SAGA+.

	Taylormade knows how to parse Spectrum .sna snapshot files
	containing these games and uses patterns in the game binary
	to locate table pointers. Currently the code will load most
	but not all the games in this format.

	To run use "taylormade game.sna".


Features

	Taylormade should eventually support all the games in this
	format. There are several complications to this goal. The
	first is that the game engine changes features by release
	much more than the Scott Adams engine did. 

	The game supports the basic commands found in all the games
	and the extensions that are so far analysed and identified.

	Graphics are not currently supported.

Working Games

	Rebel Planet

	Blizzard Pass

	He-man
		Has RAM save/load features (supported). Appears to
	have an interpreter "GET ALL" that is not.

	Temple Of Terror
		Much like He-man in game features but also adds
	an "oops" function to go back one move. The oops function 
	is supported.

	Kayleth
		Pulls some tables wrongly from the .sna but close

Untested

	Torch & Thing
