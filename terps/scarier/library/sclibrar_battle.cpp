 *
 * The object analogue of lib_npc_400_line_names_namesakes().  run400's
 * characters() (Proc_19_0_480674) has two loops calling co(object, 0)
 * (Proc_21_39_46486C) for EVERY object.  The one at 480180 sits inside the
 * examine arm (47FE63-48022A), which needs an examine verb and no task run
 * for the line, so on the task-ran lines this rule serves it never runs.
 * The other is the `give` branch (48022F-480384): c("give") and an NPC in
 * the player's room, not gated by the task-ran flag.  Each call picks the
 * object's name word
 * (lib_co_400_name_word()) and counts the present, seen objects answering to
 * it.  Exactly one sets the pending-disambiguation index Me(424) =
 * MemVar_4941EC back to -1 (46485E).  Two or more take the "Which" arm at
 * 464560, which leaves it at -2 (4645D4) or at the object (464767).  A word
 * nobody present answers to leaves it alone.  So the last object whose word
 * is on the line decides.  Anything but -1 skips the tick at 48B5B5.  With a
 * task run for the line, 48B60C prints the task's text and asks nothing.
 *
 * The decompiler writes these sentinels as `&HFF`/`&HFE`.  They are
 * LitI2_Byte, sign-extended into an Integer, which is why co() tests
 * `Me(424) < 0`.
 *
 * Measured on Cyberclones II (4.00): `give electric uniform to lightning`,
 * with the Fire Uniform worn and the Electric Uniform held, runs task 6 and
 * draws nothing that turn (runner_probes/cyber2.run400.[abc].txt).  `poke toy`
 * in p4TAMB.taf, with two present toys and no NPC, IS a turn.
 *
 * British Fox (4.00) `welsh fox rub tits` (synonym -> touch) runs task 44
 * with Welsh Fox's tits and the player's own tits both present, and IS a
 * turn: run400x's Me(424) watchpoint shows no write at all on the line
 * (runner_probes/britishfox.run400.watch.txt /
 * runner_probes/britishfox.run400.watch_trace.txt, 2026-09-24), where `x tits`
 * asks "Which tits." -- the named-NPC scan was an over-reach.
 *
 * Not modelled: the arm's 454454 prefix contest can hand the write to a
 * namesake with more Prefix words typed, which leaves the index at -1 only
 * if an earlier one-namesake word already reset it.

 * the buffer as it stands, registering no question.  A tail that names
 * nothing (`take stone with zzz`, `take stone with`) or two namesakes
 * (`take knife with stone`) sends the loop over EVERY object, and co()
 * puts the index back: one present seen namesake for an object's word on
 * the line resets it to -1, two or more set it to the object, the last
 * object named in index order deciding -- so `take ruby with stone` (the
 * ruby, index 6, after the stones) ticks and `take rope with stone` (the

 * MemVar_4941EC watchpoint (VBRNG_WATCH=4941EC, wtie_watch_trace.txt):

 * co() called from 475CF4, then the register tail 48BBF3.

 * Only a prompt raised BEFORE openclose is exposed: take (get_outer
 * 48A46D), drop and put (put_drop_list 48A462), wear and remove.  therest's
 * own crowd (`cut stone with knife`) is raised after it and stays a
 * question, and so does the generaltasks scan's.  The Runner's tail runs

 * "Who do you want to attack?" is a question the next line can answer.
 * dobattle's Who path (run400 47F01E, run390 44D1F4) leaves a line prefix in
 * MemVar_494234 (run390 MemVar_4681D0): the verb, then " with " and the
 * definite name (the mode-0 name builder) of every seen object the line
 * names, index order -- `attack with blaster` leaves "attack with the
 * blaster".  generaltasks consumes it at 48AFF3 (run390 460022): when nothing
 * has answered the line by then, the prefix is not the line itself and holds
 * no "|", the line becomes prefix & " " & line, the prefix is cleared, and
 * the handler runs again from 489FEB.  That test sits above the object and
 * character catch-alls and DontUnderstand, so a bare `gargoyle #1` or
 * `blaster` is continued, and a library command that answers is not.
 *
 * The prefix dies with the line after the one that raised it: 489FDA copies
 * it into var_98 for each freshly typed line (not for the split queue, which
 * re-enters at 489FEB), and the end of every element, 48B5FC, clears both
 * when the prefix still equals var_98.  So a Who that merely raises Who
 * again (`attack`, `attack`) is spent, `hit` then `kick` leaves "kick", and
 * `attack then gargoyle #2` answers its own question.  Measured 2026-09-13 on
 * p4BATTLEHASH (runner_probes/battlehash.run400.who.txt): 21 lines, 21 draws,
 * "You have taken 15 turns" and later 17.
 *

 * the same variable; that one is not ported.  Whether an empty line would be

 * without regard to case, always whole; an object is a candidate only if its
 * Short or an Alias matched, never a Prefix alone; it scores the number of
 * distinct input words it answers to; the highest score wins, a tie going to
 * the last such object; and the winner is then REFUSED if every word it
 * matched is also answered by another object, or its matched Alias is another
 * object's name, or it matched by Alias while another candidate exists.  A
 * refusal is turn-free, and the catch-all naming it comes from a second,

 * name nothing and so give the character catch-all.  The full record -- the
 * variant table, every measurement and the predictions that confirmed it --
 * is test/adrift4/harness/make_400_battlewith5probe.py.
 *
 * Deliberate deviation: Scarier keeps the 3.90 walk at 4.0 as well.  The 4.0
 * rule is a parser accident rather than a design -- it makes an author's own
 * naming unreachable (a Short the .taf capitalises can never be typed, and an
 * object whose Alias is its neighbour's Short can never be wielded), so
 * implementing it would refuse commands the game was written to accept.  The
 * visible cost is small and one-directional: where run400 dies turn-free in a
 * catch-all we ask "Which Sword?" and swing on the repeat, i.e. we accept
 * strictly more phrasings and never fewer.  Illegal Socks is the one corpus
 * game it shows up in, and its golden plays `with sword2`, which binds under
 * both models (test/adrift4/notes/IllegalSocks_walkthrough.md).

 * a nonsense verb gets, while run390 gives it the combat dispatch (both
 * measured live 2026-08-18, on easter.taf and The Town of Azra).
 * Deliberate deviation: Scarier takes a leading `slap` at 4.0 too, so these
 * behave as `hit` -- not `attack` -- everywhere: `hit` carries battle attack
 * index 2, `attack`/`kick` carry -1.
 *
 * `smack` and `strike` are synonyms at no version: neither literal occurs
 * anywhere in run370.bas, run380.bas, run390 Form1.frm or run400.bas.
