/*
 * lib_cmd_wield()
 *
 * Battle System weapon selection.  "wield <weapon>" sets a held weapon as the
 * player's persistent wield; the wield is cleared -- not swapped for another
 * carried weapon -- when the weapon leaves the player's hands.  There is no
 * "unwield" verb (the Runner answers "I don't understand.").  Falls through to
 * other grammar when the Battle System is disabled, as plain wielding is not
 * otherwise modelled.
 *
 * dobattle's wield block (run390 44C824-44CAB6, run400 47E764-47E9xx) loops
 * over the objects co() names, and handles one only when
 *
 *     InStr(line, Short) > InStr(line, "wield")
 *       Or InStr(line, Alias(0)) > InStr(line, "wield")
 *
 * a binary InStr of the raw field against the lower-cased line.  A Short or
 * first Alias with a capital letter can never pass, and an empty one is
 * InStr's 1, which beats "wield" only when the line does not start with it.
 * With no object passing, the line gets "I don't understand what you are
 * wanting to wield!" -- an ordinary turn.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-14 on Villains_And_Kings under run390 (Adrift_1187
 * vakwield): the sword is Prefix "Kinda Sharp", Short "Sword", Alias "blade".
 * `wield Sword`, `wield kinda sharp sword`, `wield zzz`, `wield rack` (Short
 * "Rack", empty alias) and a bare `wield` all refuse; `wield blade` wields,
 * then "already wielding", then after a drop "aren't carrying"; 21 lines,
 * 21 turns.  The 4.0 twin has the same shape, from the decompile only.
