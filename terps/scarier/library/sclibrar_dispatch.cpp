 * (Wax Worx `get marie` -> "get * head", Sommeril `take silver orb` ->

 * FOUNTAIN".  The typed spelling never reaches the tasks through this
 * handler at all -- The ADRIFT Project's `put battery in charger` comes out
 * of the synonym table as "put nickel-cadmium nickel-cadmium accumulator in
 * charger", which no pattern of its `#Charge battery` task matches, and the
 * author's own run400 transcript still shows the task firing: it is the
 * rebuild "put the small battery in the battery charger" that `put * battery
 * * charger *` claims.  Pre-4.0 offers the tasks nothing at all here: the
 * p3xPRETRY probes put the bean in the jar on all three Runners with `put a
 * bean in a jar` matched and passing (2026-09-20), and there the typed line
