 * " can't go in that direction, but" for every word except `exits`, `where`
 * and `directions` (loc_43AC7E).  That is exactly lib_go()'s own refusal, so
 * routing `exit` to lib_cmd_go_out() gets both cases right at once.
 *
 * `inside` and `outside` are absent from that twenty-word seed list, so in a
 * room without the matching exit the Runner has nothing to say and drops
 * through to the catch-all.  We print the exits summary there instead, which
 * is what lib_go() does for every other direction word; the deviation is
 * confined to the case where the movement fails.
