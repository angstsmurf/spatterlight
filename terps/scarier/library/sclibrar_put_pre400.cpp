 * The three answers a pre-4.0 "put X in Y" gives before it ever moves
 * anything, and they are decided in this order -- the object's own failure
 * outranks the container's.  Measured on p39DARK under run390:
 *
 *   runner_probes/dark.run390.putin2.txt:67
 *                  `put zzzz in box`   You can't do that!
 *   runner_probes/dark.run390.putin3.txt:27
 *                  `put stone in lamp` You can't do that!    (the stone is a
 *                  room away; the lamp is held and is not a container, and
 *                  that refusal never gets a word in)
 *   runner_probes/dark.run390.putin2.txt:40
 *                  `put coin in box`   You can't see that.   (the coin is
 *                  inside the box, the box on the floor -- present, named,
 *                  and out of reach; see lib_put_named_filter)
 *   runner_probes/dark.run390.putin3.txt:24
 *                  `put lamp in box`   Put the lamp inside what?  (the lamp
 *                  is held, the box a room away)
 *   runner_probes/dark.run390.putin.txt:34
 *                  `put coin in coin`  Put the coin inside what?
 *   runner_probes/dark.run390.putin.txt:37
 *                  `put box in box`    Put the box inside what?
 *   runner_probes/dark.run390.putin.txt:64
 *                  `put coin in me`    Put the coin inside what?
 *
 * The surface handler answers the same shapes the same way, in its own
 * preposition (p39SURF under run390): `put stone on lamp` with
 * the stone a room away is "You can't do that!"
 * (runner_probes/surf1.run390.txt:6), `put coin on table` with the coin on the
 * table and the table on the floor is "You can't see that."
 * (runner_probes/surf1.run390.txt:5), and `put coin on coin`, `put table on
 * table` and `put coin on me` are "Put the coin onto what?", "Put the table
 * onto what?" and "Put the coin onto what?"
 * (runner_probes/surf1.run390.txt:11/12/19).
 *
 * -- so the container fragment is resolved with the object already spoken
 * for, and a fragment that names only the object, or names nothing at all,
 * leaves the Runner with no container and it asks.  (4.0 answers the last
 * three "You can't put anything inside the coin!", "You can't put an object
 * inside itself!" and "I don't understand what you want to put things
 * inside." on the same turns of p4TFROM,
 * runner_probes/tfrom.run400.putin.txt:15/18/46.)
 *
 * " can't do that!" is in run370, run380 and run390 and in no run400, and
 * " can't see that." is in all four; the prompt is composed, so the census
 * cannot pin it and it is gated at 3.9, the version it was measured on.
 * 3.7 and 3.8 keep what they had.

/*
 * lib_put_task_sweep_390()
 *
 * run390's insides() moves a single named object and writes "You put X onto
 * Y." without ever setting its own result; that is left to the sweep that
 * follows, and it decides which task pass the line gets afterwards.  The
 * sweep walks every object whose o(22) is 0 (held), the player's room (a
 * dynamic lying there, or a static authored with InitialPosition 4 + room,
 * which is the only o(22) a static ever has) or &H9C (worn), and the first
 * one co() finds named in the line claims the put: the buffer is emptied,
 * tasks(1) -- checktask(line, 0), QUIET -- runs on the typed line, the
 * result becomes 1, and the put text comes back only if the buffer is
 * still empty.  A task the move enabled then speaks instead of the put
 * text; one whose restrictions fail says nothing.  Nothing named and
 * eligible means the result stays 0, and generaltasks goes on to tasks(0)
 * -- checktask(line, 1), LOUD -- with the put text still in the buffer: a
 * matched task's failing restriction overwrites it with the FailMessage
 * (452BBD), a passing one runs and replaces it.  The moved object itself
 * never qualifies (it is now &HF6/&HEC), so the usual claimant is the
 * container, and only when it is held or lying in the room.
 *
 * Measured, run390:
 *   - Lost Tomb (runner_transcripts/losttomb.txt T85): `put dung beetle on
 *     green pillar` -- pillar static, nothing else eligible named -- moves the
 *     beetle and the LOUD pass runs task 30 (bare `*`, all four animals on
 *     their pillars), whose "The four pillars slowly sink into the ground."
 *     replaces the put message.
 *   - Secret of the Lost World (runner_transcripts/secret_of_lost_world.txt
 *     T118-T119, and the probe
 *     runner_probes/secret_of_lost_world.run390.red.txt): `put red gem on
 *     statue` names the held green gem (co() matches Short "gem"; the prefix
 *     is not consulted), moves it onto the static statue, and the LOUD pass
 *     matches task 5 `* red * statue`, whose first restriction wants the red
 *     gem held: "You don't have a red gem." replaces the put text, and `x
 *     statue` then shows "A green gem is on ancient statue.".  T119 `put green
 *     gem on statue` finds the gem already there and task 6's "You don't have
 *     a green gem." is all that prints.
 *   - Troll (runner_transcripts/troll.txt T116, run400x and the drop/firewater
 *     probes runner_probes/troll.run390.{drop,fire}.txt): `put breadcrumbs in
 *     basin` with the basin HELD -- the basin claims the sweep, the QUIET
 *     pass matches task 51 `* breadcrumbs * basin *` whose second
 *     restriction fails, and the put text "You put the lot of breadcrumbs
 *     inside the wash basin." stands.
 * The "all" and "and" forms rebuild a line per object instead, and are not
 * ported.  3.9 only; run380 sweeps take-from lines instead
 * (lib_take_from_task_sweep_380()), and run400 dispatches its insides
 * look-ups before the move.

 *   - while nothing chosen so far is REACHABLE (a static in the room, or a

 *   - once one is, a later match replaces it only when its Short or alias
 *     starts further right in the line than the choice's.
 *
 * Fewer than two matches is the flat "You can't do that!" (445A2A).  Two or
 * more, and the choice is not a container or surface, is "You can't put
 * anything on|inside " & tense(Prefix) & " " & Short & "." with `on` chosen by

 * anything inside the stone." (pPUTREF39 T4,
 * runner_probes/putref.run390.txt:8), which is the wrong-kind refusal of
 * lib_put_in_is_valid().  A choice that is a valid open container or surface
 * would put the other object into it; that arm is unmeasured and declines.
 * (The Runner tests the chooser's own name against the preposition with an
