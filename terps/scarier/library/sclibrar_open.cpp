 * run400's therest (Proc_19_85_489F4C) splits a line holding " with " before
 * any verb test (4883C5-488615): the object is scored from the text before
 * it and the instrument from the text after it (463640, present and seen),
 * and either failing leaves therest silently (488430, 4884DB) for the object
 * catch-all.  A dynamic instrument not held answers "<You> don't have <X>."
 * (48856A), a static one "Don't be daft!" (48860D), and a held one becomes
 * var_9C = " with <the X>", which every refusal puts before its full stop:
 * "You can't cut the rope with the coin.", "You push the button with the
 * knife, but nothing happens.", "You can't turn the button on with the
 * knife.".  Measured 2026-09-14 on p4WITHQ.taf
 * (runner_probes/withq.run400.txt, runner_probes/withq.run400.2.txt,
 * runner_probes/withq.run400.3.txt).
 *
 * Each half is 463640 in mode 0: present and seen first, then any seen
 * object, so a half can name something the player saw and left.  An absent
 * instrument is "<You> don't have the gem." like any other not held, and
 * once both halves resolve 4887A0 answers an absent object "<You> can't see
 * the gem." (p4WITHQ2.taf, runner_probes/withq2.run400.txt, 2026-09-14).  The
 * "With what?" arm at 488505 tests an instrument neither present nor seen,
 * which 463640 never returns: it is dead.  run390's twin answers differently,
 * and it serves 3.70 and 3.80 as well; see lib_with_clause_390().

 * the desk drawer seen but inside the closed desk answer "The desk drawer is
 * not locked!" (runner_transcripts/sswhore.txt, T84/T97), where our %object%
 * scope saw nothing and answered "You can't unlock that." and a key prompt.
 *
 * The whole arm runs on that object, not just its state refusal: from Beta,
 * with p4LOCK's box left locked in Alpha and its key -- the coin -- in hand,
 * run400 answers `lock box with coin` "You lock the box with the coin." and
 * then `unlock box` "You unlock the box with the coin.", and only the
 * openness refusals when the box is already in the state asked for
 * (make_400_lockprobe.py / runner_probes/lock.run400.b.txt, 2026-09-20).
 * Returns the object, or -1 when the present pass matched or tied, when the
 * head names nothing seen, or when the object has no Openable/Key for the arm
 * to work on.
