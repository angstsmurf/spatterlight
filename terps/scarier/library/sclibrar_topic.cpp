 * lib_ask_npc_topic_after_task_390()
 *
 * 3.9: a topic answers an ask even when a task has already answered the line,
 * and replaces what the task printed.  run390's character handler enters its
 * `c("ask") Or c("talk to")` block (4597FE) with no test of the task-ran flag
 * MemVar_468198, and every topic reply is a plain assignment to the message
 * buffer (459A7A, 459AA7, 459AD4), so the task's text is overwritten, not
 * joined.  Only a reply does that: the no-topic answer (459B46) is written over
 * an empty or "can't talk to that." buffer alone, and the NPC must be in the
 * player's room (459941).  4.0 gates the same block on the flag (run400
 * 47F900), so there a task keeps the line.
 *
 * Measured on Zombies Are Cool (ZAC.taf, 3.90; run390x Adrift_1061_zombies.txt,
 * turns 10-14, 29 and 30): the task `talk to stu` / `ask stu about *` prints
 * "Stu shakes his head, as if he doesn't understand the question.", and run390
 * shows Stu's topic reply alone on every one of them.
 *
 * The task that ran may also have printed NOTHING: then the buffer the ask
 * block finds is empty, and with no topic the no-response answer (459B46) is
 * written after all.  That is the toronto case (A Day In Toronto, 3.90; run390x
 * runner_transcripts/toronto.txt T9): task 3 `ask waiter about burger` has no
 * CompleteText and only moves the burger in, and the Runner answers the line
 * with the Waiter's topic "ok" where the silent-task rule alone would have
 * printed the game's DontUnderstand "huh?".  How a silent task's line reaches
 * characters() at all is run_all_commands()' business: see the note on
 * lib_line_names_npc_390().
 *
 * Called once uip_match() has matched "ask %character% about %text%" or its
 * talk-to twin.  Replies, cutting the buffer back to mark first, and returns
 * TRUE; prints nothing and returns FALSE when no present NPC or topic answers
 * -- unless over_empty_buffer says the buffer is empty at mark, when the
 * present NPC's no-response answer is printed instead and TRUE returned.
