/*
 * lib_cmd_take_absent()
 *
 * 4.0's named take once nothing here can answer to the noun.  The Runner's
 * take handler (run400 Proc_19_6) resolves the direct object with the co()
 * style whole-name resolver General.Sub_22_66, whose result is 255 for "the
 * line named nothing", a positive index+256 for one object, and -(index + 2)
 * for an ambiguity; the three answers are printed at the tail of the same
 * procedure -- "Take what?" (and again as the very last default), "It is not
 * clear which " & <term> & " you are referring to.", and "There is nothing
 * worth taking here.", which is where a line that resolved an object but took
 * nothing lands (the `> 255` test at 00073798 is the "take X from Y" test, so
 * a plain named take falls straight through to it).
 *
 * The resolver runs its scan TWICE.  Its first pass (mode 1) only considers
 * what Sub_22_61 calls present -- held, worn, in the room, or inside an open
 * container there -- and if that pass ends with no candidate at all it resets
 * the mode to 0 and jumps back to the top of the procedure (00063465), where
 * the test is the object's seen byte alone.  So the noun that names nothing
 * here is offered every object the player has ever SEEN, and that second pass
 * is what this function reproduces.
 *
 * What it ranges over is measured rather than argued:
 * harness/make_400_takeprobe.py builds p4TAKE (a coin loose in Alpha, a
 * statue static in Alpha, a widget and a gizmo loose in Bravo), with --tie
 * p4TAKE2 (a red widget and a blue widget, both Short "widget" with Prefix "a
 * red"/"a blue", plus a lamp aliased "light", all in Bravo), and with
 * --hidden p4TAKE3 (the same pair, with tasks that move either or both of
 * them to hidden).  Six feeds under Wine, run400, transcripts
 * runner_probes/take.run400.*.txt:
 *
 *     take widget   (Bravo never entered)        ->  Take what?
 *     take widget   (from Alpha, Bravo seen)     ->  There is nothing worth
 *                                                    taking here.
 *     take statue   (from Bravo, Alpha seen)     ->  There is nothing worth
 *                                                    taking here.
 *     take light    (from Alpha, an ALIAS)       ->  There is nothing worth
 *                                                    taking here.
 *     take widget   (two seen absent namesakes)  ->  It is not clear which
 *                                                    widget you are referring
 *                                                    to.
 *     take widget   (one, then both, hidden)     ->  It is not clear which
 *                                                    widget you are referring
 *                                                    to.
 *     take red      (a Prefix word only)         ->  Take what?
 *     take zzz                                   ->  Take what?
 *     take widget   (both present, in Bravo)     ->  Which widget.  The red
 *                                                    widget or the blue
 *                                                    widget?
 *
 * So the candidate set is the objects the player has SEEN -- the same seen
 * byte the examine path reads, and the same one that makes `x widget` answer
 * "You can't see the widget from here!" in the very next command of
 * runner_probes/take.run400.2.txt -- matched by WHOLE name, Short or Alias,
 * with a Prefix word naming nothing on its own.  Statics count (the statue)
 * and so do hidden objects (p4TAKE3's pair still ties with both of them
 * nowhere).  A candidate that is present hands the line back to the ordinary
 * path, which is where the present tie's co() prompt is raised.
 *
 * The scores then decide between the two refusals, and only a genuine tie for
 * the best score is ambiguous.  That is what zelda's `get key` turns on: its
 * super-hot key is Short "key" with an Alias "key" as well, so it scores 2
 * against the iron key's 1 and wins outright -- run400 answers with the flat
 * refusal (runner_transcripts/zelda.txt:573) even though both keys are seen
 * and both are called "key".
