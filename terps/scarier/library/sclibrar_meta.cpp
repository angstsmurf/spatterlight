 * lib_cmd_look_typed()
 *
 * The typed room look.  The Runner does not parse it: generaltasks compares
 * the whole line, after the game's SYNONYM rewrites, against a short list --
 *
 *     run400 48A5E3 / run390 45F5F2:  l, look, x room, x location,
 *         examine room, look room, examine location, l room
 *     run380 442377 / run370 43BB23:  l, look, x room, x location
 *
 * -- so bare `x`, `ex`, `examine`, `look at` and `the room` forms are not a
 * look.  Bare `x`, `ex` and `examine` are not an examine either: examines
 * opens with `If input = "examine" Or "ex" Or "x" Then Exit` (run400 471340,
 * run390 44B758), and the line ends in the game's DontUnderstand.  Measured
 * on Lair of the Vampire (4.00), whose synonym 2 rewrites `look` to `x`:
 * run400 answers `look` with "Try something different." in three separate
 * captures (Adrift_131/332/674_lair.txt), and because the room is never
 * listed, the cobalt key an earlier task dropped there stays unseen and the
 * next `get all` leaves it behind.
 *
 * 3.7/3.8 examines has no such exit, but the list is just as exact, so a
 * bare `x`, `ex`, `examine`, `exam` or `look at` enters examines and
 * answers "Nothing special." there, as do `examine room`, `look room`, `x
 * the room`, `look at room` and `look around`; `l room` is DontUnderstand.
 * Only the four listed lines look, in any case.  (`x,` is "Nothing
 * special." there too: the comma ends the word -- see
 * uip_match_whitespace().)  p37EXAM/p38EXAM, run370x
 * Adrift_173_pbare37.rtf / Adrift_175_pbare37b.rtf, run380x
 * Adrift_172_pbare38.rtf / Adrift_174_pbare38b.rtf
 * (`cmdfile_p3738bare.txt`, `cmdfile_p3738bare2.txt`).
 *
 * Deliberate deviation: below 3.9 any line this row matches that names the
 * room or location looks, so `examine room`, `look at room` and `x the
 * room` show the room instead of "Nothing special.".  The bare forms keep
 * the Runner's answer.

 * machinery either: the Runner writes the two lines inline in generaltasks and
 * then sets the gameover byte, so there is no WinText, no "Better luck next
 * time.", and no "Well done - you scored maximum points!" / "You finished N
 * points short." line -- those live in Form1.endmessage, which this path never

 *       out &= "[Press any key to end]"
 *       gameover = 3
 *
 * Note the order: the "out of the maximum" figure is the game's real MaxScore,
 * and the 0 -> 1 fix-up applies only to the divisor, so a scoreless game gets
 * "out of the maximum 0!" and "That is 0% of the game!".  That differs from
 * task_print_end_game_summary(), which follows Form1.endmessage in skipping
 * the whole summary for a scoreless 4.0 game and reporting a scoreless pre-4.0
 * one as 100%, so the two printers are deliberately kept apart.
 *
 * All four Runners carry the branch, identically worded (run370 loc_43C095,

 *         so the line falls through to the game's DontUnderstand.
 *   3.80  knows the word and has nothing behind it: run380 generaltasks
 *         @442EE9 tests `c("undo")` and answers "I can't undo your
 *         blundering." every time, with no state to restore.
 *   3.90+ answers "Undone." on success (run390 do_undo @436AB5, run400
 *         Proc_19_62 @45B0FF) and "I can't undo any more of your
 *         blunderings!" when the history is empty (@45B158).
 *
 * "[The previous turn has been undone.]", "Sorry, no more undo is
 * available." and "You can't undo what hasn't been done." are in no Runner's
 * pool at all, and neither Runner prints a room name with the answer:
 * Adrift_361_cellar.txt (4.00) reads plain "Undone." three times running.
 *
 * 3.9 and 4.0 also REPLAY the restored turn's output.  Each Runner keeps a
 * 10-deep record array (run400 MemVar_494124) whose field 0 is the turn's
 * whole output buffer, stamped from MemVar_4941B0 -- the output of the turn
 * before -- when the record is written at the start of each line (@48BD6E);
 * `undo` reads slot *1* and prints "Undone." & vbCrLf & the text that slot
 * holds, so undoing `e` re-prints what `take satchel` said, the next undo
 * what `x chair` said (Adrift_687_cellar), and Adrift_892_hero's
 * wait/wait/undo re-prints the first "Time passes...".  An emptied slot is
 * stamped "!!" (@45B146) and that sentinel is what the availability test
 * reads (@45AE5C); run390 do_undo has the same shape.  Scarier keeps the text
 * beside each undo state: the flushed output taken as the temporary game is
