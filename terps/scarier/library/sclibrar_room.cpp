   * room blank; 4.0 dropped it again.
   *
   * Read the guard, not the literal: hanging the sentence off an empty Long
   * alone moves 16 of the 303 corpus goldens.  The guard needs BOTH halves:
   * the alt text empty AND the Long itself empty (`var_A4(4) = vbNullString`
   * at 4478C0, the room record's Long, not what got printed).  yeh.taf
   * (3.90) measured on run390x 2026-09-12: "Outside", "Woods", "Spooky
   * area." each have a Long and a start alt that suppresses it with empty
   * text, and the Runner prints the heading and the exits alone.
   *
   * Measured on p39EXAM.taf (3.90), runner_probes/exam.run390.txt and
   * runner_probes/exam.run390.held.txt: the Void Room has an empty Long, no
   * alts and no objects, and both `e` and `look` answer "There is nothing of

/*
 * lib_print_room_exits()
 *
 * Append the exits list to a room description if the ShowExits global
 * requests it.  The run400 room builder itself runs the "exits" command at
 * the end of every room display when MemVar_4941E9 (ShowExits) is set, and
 * strips the result again if it ends "any direction!" (@00472BFF-00472C64
 * in Proc_19_63_472CA4) -- so this applies to task ShowRoomDesc displays
 * just as much as to player-room ones.
 *
 * When the list is kept, the builder first PRINTS the turn's text so far --
 * it saves the message buffer (472C18), lets "exits" overwrite it, and sends
 * the saved text & "  " through the filtering print routine 47B568 (472C64)
 * -- so every %variable% and ALR in the move line and the room description
 * is resolved there and then, before the NPC walks and events tick.  Only the
 * exits list and what follows waits for the end of the turn.  All four
 * Runners do this: run390 44813D-44818D, run380 439B83, run370 433108.
 * Measured on wumpusrun (run400x, seed 72, equal 115-draw streams): its ALR
 * "You move" -> "{move%move%}" reads the variable EVENT 0's task redraws
 * every turn, and the Runner printed the value from before the tick on all
 * four move turns (depart/boldly go/head/boldly go = 2,5,8,5), where
 * interpolating at the flush printed the redrawn value.  pf_print_so_far()
 * filters the text there and freezes it, so it is not filtered again: a
 * plain checkpoint left it to the flush's second ALR walk, which put
 * adrift_maze's "twisty" through its twist ALR twice and patched Qui a tue
 * Dana's "Vous vous deplacez in." to the "Vous entrez." run400 never prints.
 *
 * That "  " is a literal, not pspace(), so the exits sentence joins the room
 * block on its line whatever ends it, and follows a bare heading with two
 * leading spaces.  Every Runner shows it: `look` in the p2give probe world is
 * "... Bob is here.  You can only move north." at all four versions
 * (runner_probes/ord.run370.give.rtf and runner_probes/ord.run380.give.rtf are
 * the scrollback itself), and egghunt's empty-Long rooms print "The Holy City"
 * then "  You can move north, south and west."
 * (runner_transcripts/egghunt.txt).  Scarier deliberately drops the two spaces
 * where they would open a line (deviation policy; see lib_buffer_literal_gap).
