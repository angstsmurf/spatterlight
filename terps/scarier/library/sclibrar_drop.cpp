/*
 * lib_name_object_resolve_400()
 *
 * The noun resolver a plain 4.0 `drop X` or `take X` goes through:
 * put_drop_list 459DB4 hands the whole line to name_object 46E5D8, which
 * calls Proc_21_58_463640(line, 2, 0), and the take handler the same thing
 * with mode 1.  Both modes are two passes over the objects in index order:
 * pass 0 takes only one side of the room -- what the player holds or wears,
 * directly or inside or on something held, for mode 2, and for mode 1
 * exactly what it will not (lib_resolve_admit_take()) -- and pass 1
 * everything present; mode 2 has no seen gate.  Each object is scored as
 * lib_verb_object_name_score() does, and
 *
 *   - the first hit of a pass (result < 0 and count = 0) becomes the result
 *     whatever its score, and pass 0 marks it;
 *   - a hit equal to the best score is a tie: the result becomes
 *     -(object+2) and pass 0 marks the object -- but first Me(424), the
 *     pending object, is set to this object if its Short equals the Short
 *     of object Abs(result) (4633F0).  After the first tie the result is
 *     -(k+2), so the comparison is with the object TWO indexes past the last
 *     tied one, not with the tied object itself;
 *   - a higher score takes the result outright, resets the count and
 *     Me(424), and leaves every earlier mark standing.
 *
 * The best score is not reset between the passes.  A pass-0 tie (or
 * nothing) saves the count and Me(424) and runs pass 1; pass 1 restores the
 * saved Me(424) when it counted more hits than pass 0.  The list the prompt
 * shows (Me(428)) is always the pass-0 marks.
 *
 * name_object then says "It is not clear which <term> you are referring
 * to." for a tie with no pending object (term 446C74 of the last tied
 * object: its Short if the line has it, else its first alias the line has),
 * and generaltasks prompts "Which <term>.  <list>?" for one with a pending
 * object (term its Short replaced by the last of its aliases the line has)
 * -- administrative, as every such prompt is.
 * Measured on wilkins T110-T117 (runner_transcripts/wilkins.txt): with the
 * base tincture and the tinctures of alice, gertrude, irene, leanor, marie,
 * mary and rose held, `drop tincture of alice`, `... gertrude` and
 * `... marie` are not clear, `... irene` and `... mary` ask "Which
 * tincture.", `... leanor` and `... rose` drop, and `drop tincture of wai
 * lin` (on the floor) drops the base tincture, the one held object the line
 * names.
 *
 * IS_TAKE swaps pass 0 for the take side, and p4TAKER measured that this one
 * model decides which of the two answers a crowded take reaches as well
 * (run400 runner_probes/taker.run400.txt).  Its world is five
 * pairs of namesakes, every Prefix "a" so no Prefix word narrows anything,
 * and the ten lines fall out cell for cell:
 *
 *   take gem   both loose, one Short    Which gem.  The gem or the gem?
 *   take cog   one held, one loose      You take the cog.
 *   take pad   both HELD, one Short     It is not clear which pad ...
 *   take orb   both loose, one by ALIAS It is not clear which orb ...
 *   take tin   held Short, loose alias  You take the pin.
 *   drop gem   both loose               It is not clear which gem ...
 *   drop cog   both held, one Short     Which cog.  The cog or the cog?
 *   drop pad   both held, one Short     Which pad.  The pad or the pad?
 *   drop orb   both loose, one by ALIAS It is not clear which orb ...
 *   drop tin   both held, one by ALIAS  It is not clear which tin ...
 *
 * So the question needs BOTH a tie the verb's own pass makes -- pass 1
 * restoring the saved Me(424) is what flattens `take pad` and `drop gem`,
 * where the verb's side of the room held nothing and pass 1 counted more --
 * and two tied objects with the same Short, which is what flattens every
 * pair joined by an alias.  It also retro-explains p4OPENA's `take gem`
 * (runner_probes/opena.run400.txt): the gem and the rock aliased "gem" were
 * both loose by then, so it is the `take orb` cell.
 *
 * MODE 4 is mode 1 with a container named (get_piece's var_92 <> &HFF): one
 * pass over what is visibly in or on disambig.resolve_parent_400; see
 * lib_take_from_piece_400().
 *
 * MODE 0 is the plain one-pass scan most of the Runner's callers use, the
 * co(i, 0) gate and no second chance (lib_resolve_admit_mode0()); openclose
 * is one of them, and the pending object is what decides whether a crowded
 * `open X Y Z` asks or is flat.  See lib_open_close_tie_400().
 *
 * Returns the resolved object, -1 for a tie (with *PENDING, *LAST_TIED and
 * MARKED filled), or -2 when nothing scored in the last pass either, the
 * fallback the existing path covers.

 * Below 4.0 `leave` is a third spelling of `drop`, and not a verb of its

 * c("leave") Or (c("put") And c("down") And <flag> = 0)`, so a `leave` line
 * enters the drop handler and takes whichever of its arms the rest of the
 * line picks.  4.0's drops() still tests the word, but nothing routes a `leave`
 * line to it: run400 answers every one of them from the catch-all, which is
 * what Scarier already does, so these rows decline there.
 *
 * Measured on p37/p38/p39/p4DROPGATE (loose coin and pebble, held
 * bean and cloak; make_3738_dropgateprobe.py, which now builds the 4.0 world
 * too), transcripts runner_probes/dropgate.run*.leavegate.* and
 * runner_probes/dropgate.run370.leaveall.rtf:
 *
 *   leave bean     "You drop the bean."       -- named and held
 *   leave coin     "You don't have a coin!"   -- named, loose in the room
 *                  ("You don't have the coin!" at 3.9)
 *   leave qqq      "Drop what?"               -- names nothing
 *   leave          "Drop what?"
 *   leave north    "Drop what?", and the player does not move: generaltasks
 *                  calls drops() well above moves(), and a claimed line
 *                  jumps to the turn tail
 *   leave all      "You drop the bean and the cloak."
 *   leave bean and cloak / leave all except bean -- `drop`'s own answers
 *   leave everything, hands empty   "You are not carrying anything."
 *
 * 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 answer that feed identically bar the 3.9 article, and

 * `leave`.  run400 answers the same feed "I don't understand." and "I don't
 * understand what you want me to do with the bean." throughout
 * (runner_probes/dropgate.run400.leavegate.txt).
 *
 * Only the drop arms take the new spelling; the put rows keep `drop` and `put
 * down` alone.  `drop X in Y` is not a put before 4.0 either -- run390
 * answers `drop lamp in box` with "You drop the lamp." (p39SURF,
 * runner_probes/surf.run390.leaveput.txt) where Scarier puts the lamp inside
 * the box -- but that is the put rows' own deviation ("`drop X in Y` is not
