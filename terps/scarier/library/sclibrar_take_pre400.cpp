/*
 * lib_take_held_namesake_preempt_pre400()
 *
 * The pre-4.0 takes() walks EVERY object in index order and lets each one
 * whose Short or Alias sits in the typed line write the answer, whether or
 * not it is the object the line meant.  A held one writes "<You>'ve already
 * got <object>!" (run390 @454EC5) and a worn one "<You> are already wearing
 * <object>!", both raising the outcome rank to 4.  The branch that takes an
 * object out of a container, off a surface or from a character -- the one
 * that rewrites the line into "take X from <parent>" -- is gated on the
 * buffer being still empty (or " pick up "/" from here!") AND rank < 3
 * (run390 @4551E4), so a held namesake indexed BELOW the target has already
 * spoken and the target is never taken.  An object lying loose in the room
 * is different: "<You> pick up X." overwrites the buffer, so only the
 * not-in-the-room targets lose.
 *
 * Measured in run390 (runner_transcripts/stardust T38): `take
 * needle box` with the sharp needle (object 3) in hand and the needle box
 * (object 12) on the desk answers "You've already got the sharp needle!"
 * and leaves the box where it was -- T99 `put needle in box` is then "You
 * don't have the box.".  secret_of_lost_world T53 `take blue gem` with the
 * green gem (11) held and the blue gem (12) on the fresh skeleton: "You
 * already have the green gem!" (the game's ALR of "You've already got"),
 * the blue gem still listed on the skeleton at T55.  Scarier resolved the
 * line to the box / the blue gem alone and took it.
 *
 * Only the single-named plain take: the "and" list and "all" walk other modes
 * of the loop.  Below 3.9 the object prints its raw prefix, as the
 * already-got list below does (p38EXAM, runner_probes/exam.run380.txt).  3.7
 * has no from-parent branch at all -- a bare take of something in or on an
 * object writes nothing (lib_take_filter) -- so there the namesake speaks
 * from either side of the target; the last one in index order, as every write
 * overwrites.  A 3.8/3.9 namesake ABOVE the target is left alone: the rewrite
 * has run by the time it speaks and what the caller does with the rewritten
 * line is unmeasured.
 */
/*
 * The test the takes() loop puts each object through before letting it
 * write: run390 @454E1D co(obj, 1), run380 @43DFC3 co(obj), run370 @4364E6
 * a bare c(Short).  co() (run390 @43B6BC) is false unless the object's
 * Short or Alias sits in the line; the term found is then counted over every
 * present object answering to it (obhere, and seen from 3.9 --
 * lib_co_candidate).  With more than one, 3.9's mode 1 recounts only the
 * ones lying loose in the player's room (field 22 = room) and uses that
 * count when it is not zero; if the term is still ambiguous the object
 * passes only when the last word of its own Prefix is in the line, otherwise
 * 3.9 asks that the object itself be present and seen (@43B661) where 3.8
 * passes it outright (@42DDEA).  So `take blue plate` with the red plate in
 * hand and the blue
 * one seen in the dishwasher does NOT let the red plate speak: two "plate"s
 * present, none loose, and "red" is not in the line -- deardiary T52
 * (runner_transcripts/deardiary, run390): "I take a blue plate from the
 * dishwasher.".  Nor does life_of_mike T28 `take truck keys` (run380) with
 * the mustang keys, aliased "keys" too, in hand.

 * 454B95) and, for every dynamic object lying directly in the player's room
 * that co(obj, 1) -- a bare c(Short) at 3.7 -- finds in the line, raises two
 * counters: one for the match and, when the last word of that object's own
 * Prefix is NOT typed, a second that also stamps a per-object flag.  Only
 * when BOTH counters come out at exactly 1 are the flags wiped again, and
 * the loop that takes objects passes over every object whose flag still
 * stands (run390 454E47).  So a line naming two present, takeable objects
 * takes NEITHER, writes nothing, and comes out of takes() at the buffer-
 * empty catch-all as "Take what?" (run390 45588D).  The "Which <X> would you
 * like to take." prompt two lines above that clear (run390 454CAD) is dead
 * code in all three: its guard is the second counter exceeding the first,
 * and the second counter can never outrun the first.
 *
 * A HELD object is not a candidate -- the pre-pass tests field 22 against
 * the room constant -- so it neither blocks nor is blocked, and the main
 * loop still lets it write "<You>'ve already got <X>!" before a loose object
 * indexed above it overwrites that with the take.  Hence `take hat coin`
 * with the hat in hand is "You pick up the coin." and carries both, while
 * `take coin hat` with both on the floor is "Take what?" and carries
 * neither.  A word that names nothing costs nothing: `take zzz coin` takes
 * the coin.  4.0 dropped the pre-pass; there the line is the noun scorer's
 * and the answer is "It is not clear which <object> you are referring to."
 * for the highest-indexed object it names, which Scarier already gives.

 * (runner_probes/ord.run*.mult.*).

 * still the bare seed is "Please take objects from one place at a time."
 * (43E996; run370 has no such line), and the rewritten line then
 * reaches insides(), whose answer -- the take-from, or its nothing-inside
 * refusal -- replaces that one: `take nut and cup` with the nut in a held
 * open box is "You take a nut from the box.", while `take nut and key` with
 * the box on the floor stays at "Please take objects from one place at a

 * The noun half of "a library verb is matched anywhere in the line".  Below
 * 4.0 neither takes() nor drops() parses the words after its verb: each one
 * walks the object table in index order and asks co() whether the object's
 * Short or an Alias stands ANYWHERE in the typed line -- takes() with mode 1
 * (run390 454E1D) and drops() with mode 2 (run390 4458CF, and the same walk
 * in run380 and run370).  So a word the line holds that names nothing costs
 * nothing: `blorp take coin` is "You pick up the coin." and
 * `blorp drop coin` "You drop the coin." in all three older Runners
 * (p37REW/p38REW/p39REW, make_rewriteprobe.py --
 * runner_probes/rew.run3[789]0.casc.*), and so are `take zzz hat`
 * and `drop zzz hat` at 3.9 (p39WHAT, runner_probes/what.run390.what2.txt,
 * same day).  Scarier binds %text% positionally, so with the verb hoisted to
 * the front by run_hoist_verb_line() the rest of the line went to the noun
 * and the take fell to "Take what?" while the drop fell to the absent row's
 * "You don't have a coin!".
 *
 * Only from the parse's failure branch, so every line whose words the parser
 * does account for keeps the answer it had; and only when ONE object in the
 * whole table answers the line, the caller's own filter accepting it.  Both
 * halves matter.  A crowd still reaches the disambiguation the Runner's own
 * namesake count asks for; and a second co() match the filter would reject
 * is not passed over, because the Runner walks those objects in the same
 * loop and they write their own refusals from it -- drops()' " don't have
 * <X>!" (run390 445CE3) for a namesake that is not held --
 * and which of the two speaks is decided by index order and a message-empty
 * gate that nothing here measures.  wrecked (run380) `drop room key` is that
 * case: the small key is in hand where the room key is not, and the answer
 * has to stay the refusal it was.  The "all" and "and" arms walk co()
 * themselves (lib_take_and_pre400, lib_drop_and_arm_collect_pre400) and are
 * left alone here.
