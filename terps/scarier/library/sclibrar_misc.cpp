 *     run390 45A07C-45A09C   run400 4801AD-48021F
 *
 * All four are the same clause, inside characters()' examine branch, and all
 * four compose the same sentence: person word, " cannot see ", the record's
 * Name verbatim, " from here.".  It is a REWRITE, not a handler -- it fires
 * only when the message the turn has produced so far is the examine tail
 * itself, which is what makes this the right place for it:
 *
 *     pre-4.0   msg contains "<player> can't see that", or msg is exactly
 *               "Nothing special."
 *     4.0       msg contains "<player> can't see that", or msg is exactly
 *               "<player> see no such thing."  AND the character's seen
 *               byte (var_140(26)) is 1.
 *
 * That seen byte is the whole 3.9-vs-4.0 difference, and it is already
 * measured from the other side: run400 on EV16 answers `x dave`, with Dave
 * alive in the next room and never yet met, "You see no such thing." rather
 * than naming him (Adrift_1_ev16.txt; see lib_cmd_examine_other below).
 * Pre-4.0 has no such test -- probe 1 on ALEXIS.TAF under run390 named an
 * unseen character back at the player (cmdfile_alexis_absent_npc_1.txt,
 * probe_alexis_121.txt).  The 4.0 half is measured too: cobl (4.00), `x cat`
 * for the ginger cat seen in an earlier room, "You cannot see the ginger cat
 * from here."
 *
 * The reference test is the shared Name-or-first-Alias one, run390 4592B8
 * (`c(LCase(Name)) Or c(LCase(Alias))`); see lib_npc_named_in_line().
 *
 * The one suppression: if the line names the character by its ALIAS and also
 * names any object, the rewrite is skipped (run390 459FFE-45A041 sets
 * var_252 from co(); run400 480172-4801A7 does the same through
 * Proc_21_39_46486C).  A character named only by its Name never runs that
 * scan, so `x goblin` against an object called "goblin" still speaks.  The
 * first named absent character wins: the rewrite destroys the message the
 * guard tests, so no later character in the loop can pass it.
 *
 * The guard is an EQUALITY against the engine's own default, so where the
 * game ALRs that default the answer depends on WHEN the Runner applies its
 * ALRs -- before characters() the equality would miss and the ALR'd tail
 * would stand.  Scarier applies them in the output filter, after this hook,
 * and that is now measured rather than assumed:
 *
 *   run400, p4ALRNPC.taf (Adrift_126.txt), ALRs "You see no such thing." ->
 *     "... , or else it is unimportant." and "cannot see" -> "cannot spot".
 *     `x dave` from the next room, Dave seen: "You cannot spot Dave from
 *     here."  The rewrite fired against the UNALR'd default, and its own
 *     output was then ALR'd -- so the ALR pass runs strictly after this one.
 *     `x erin` (alive, never seen) gives the ALR'd tail on the same path,
 *     which is the seen gate and the ALR wiring in one control.
 *   run390, p39ALRNPC.taf (Adrift_966.txt), the same world with "Nothing
 *     special." ALR'd instead: `x dave` and `x erin` both answer "You cannot
 *     spot <Name> from here." -- the pre-4.0 arm, with no seen gate.
 *
 * Both transcripts are identical to scarier's on every turn.  That settles
 * the_pk_girl t~3067, whose golden line this rule moved.

 * message that CONTAINS "<player> can't see that", which is the darkness
 * tail as well as the lit one, so the absent-character rewrite still wins in
 * a dark room -- and that is why it is tested first here.
 *
 * The object-found-but-silent default one branch up is the SAME 4.0 rewrite
