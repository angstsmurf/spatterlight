 *   - inventory, the help hint, give, say, a direction and `hint` (an exact
 *     line) all lose to the sit: `i sit`, `sit i`, `inventory sit`, `n sit`,
 *     `sit n`, `north sit`, `help sit`, `hint sit`, `say hello sit`, `give

 *     `If msg = "" Then` (run390 45FFE8, 460004), so therest never speaks.

 *     `wear hat sit` wears the hat and says "You sit down on the ground."
 *     (x me: "...sitting down. You are wearing a hat."); `remove hat sit`
 *     removes it the same way, 4.0 included.
 *   - `score` anywhere (run390 45F6B5, run400 48A6AE) and the swearing arm
 *     (run390 45F8E4-45F9CE, run400 48A976) come AFTER sitstand and
 *     overwrite it: `score sit` sits and prints the score, `shit sit` sits
 *     and prints the language line.  `bugger`/`bloody` only where that
 *     Runner's list has them.
 *   - characters() runs last and overwrites too.  `talk to bob sit` sits and
 *     answers 'Use the format "ask Bob about [subject]".' at every version
 *     (c("talk to"), run390 45973D).  `ask bob about hat sit` sits and
 *     answers "BOB HAT."; `sit ask bob about hat` does so only in 4.0 --
 *     the pre-4.0 ask arm wants the character's name at column 5, i.e.
 *     "ask <name> ..." leading the line (InStr(...) <> 5 skips it, run390
 *     459818-459895), so 3.7/3.8/3.9 answer "You sit down on the ground."
 * run_line runs the standard rows on a stripped line for the wear/remove
 * and 3.7/4.0 put pre-runs.  On FALSE with *rest set, the caller should
 * dispatch the rest of the line from *rest (the sit words cut), so the ask

 * openclose is a plain Call, entered on c("open") / c("close") -- the whole

 * line below sitstand (run400 48A515, run390 45F512, run380 4422xx, run370
 * 43B9xx).  It cannot claim, so the handlers below it overwrite its message
 * while keeping its act, and the ones above it claim the line before it is
 * reached.  Measured on p37ORD..p4ORD (make_orderprobe.py; run370x
 * runner_probes/ord.run370.ord2.rtf, run380x
 * runner_probes/ord.run380.ord2.rtf, run390x
 * runner_probes/ord.run390.ord2.txt, run400x
 * runner_probes/ord.run400.ord2.txt, 2026-09-21), the box shut before each
 * cell:
 *   x open box, open examine box, open look at box   the description of an
 *   open read box, open x box (3.7-3.9)              OPEN box; it opened
 *   open where is box                 "You are carrying the box!", and open
 *   push open box, open x box (4.0)   "You open the box.", therest silent
 *   open take box                     "You take the box.", and still shut
 *   wear open hat                     "You put on the hat." (hat unopenable)
 * The Runner's own gate is the message buffer: its two refusals, " can't
 * open " (4756EA) and " can't see " (475952), are written only when nothing
 * has spoken yet, while the success (475822), " is already open!" (47592D),
 * " as it is locked!" (4757A5) and " not carrying " (4758D3) are plain
 * assignments that overwrite.  So the act, not the refusal, is what carries
 * past a handler above it, and that is the test here: the pass runs the
 * open/close row for its ACT on a line re-spelled with the word at the head,
 * takes the message back when a handler below openclose will speak for the
 * line, and hands that handler the line with the open/close word cut out.
 *
 * Only open and close are read.  The lock and unlock arms of the same proc
 * (475D71, 47612F) are called just as unconditionally, but no probe row has
 * stood them beside a second verb, and "pick lock" is a task command in four
 * of the walkthroughs.
