 * ADRIFT 5 support for Scarier -- tiny string helpers shared by every a5 file.
 *
 * These four were independently copy-pasted into most of the a5*.cpp files (five
 * copies of streq alone) before being collected here.  Deliberately free of any
 * engine dependency -- only <string.h>/<ctype.h>/<string> -- so that the
 * self-contained translation units (a5sexpr.cpp, which knows nothing of the
 * model) can include it as readily as the runner does.
