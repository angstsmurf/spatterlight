   *
   * At 4.0 the length does not matter: EVERY restart-after-delay event with

   * -1 and the event never starts again.  Probed live 2026-09-19 in run400
   * (probe EVRS, make_arena_probe.py, runner_probes/evrs.run400.txt): R2
   * (RestartType 2, immediate starter, length 2) printed "R2 FINISH." on the
   * first wait and nothing afterwards -- no StartText, no LookText in the
   * final `look` -- where the control R1 (RestartType 1) printed "R1 FINISH.
   * R1 START." every three turns.  Scarier used to re-arm R2 every two
   * turns.  The Rnd is still consumed, so draw it here to keep the stream
   * cadence.
   *
   * Pre-4.0 is the same: run390 448E23-448E7F and run370 43249F-4324F4 set
   * waiting on a StartTime/EndTime roll, and their waiting blocks decrement
   * first too.  Probe pEVROLL event C (immediate starter, RestartType 2, Time
   * 2; make_39_evrollprobe.py, run390x runner_probes/evroll.run390.txt,
   * run380x runner_probes/evroll.run380.rtf) printed "C FINISH." on turn 2
   * only and no "C LOOK." afterwards.  The run390 variant d that re-arms with
   * its StartText every time has a random-delay starter, whose
   * StartTime/EndTime are real.
   *
   * Restart-immediately is deliberately NOT gated: run400 really does start
   * such an event again -- EV5's H1 printed its StartText a second time and

 * evt_check_events_started_by_task()
 *
 * The 4.0 Runner's "execute task" action does more than run the task.  Its
 * execute_action (48E860, type 5 at 48D588) runs the named task through
 * task_dispatch_filter (45FB78) and then, at 48D5DE-48D638, loops over
 * every event: `If events(i).TaskNum - 1 = task And gamestate = 0 Then
 * checkevent(i)`.  So an event started by a task that an ACTION executes
 * advances at once, inside the action, wherever that happens -- in the
 * player's own command, or in the middle of the events pass when a
 * finishing event's TaskAffected executes the task.  The loop runs whether
 * or not the filter let the task run, and TaskNum 0 never matches.
 *
 * It matters because of the snapshot rule (evt_snapshot_starter_tasks): a
 * task completed by a finishing event's actions AFTER the pass has been past
 * the events it starts would otherwise be snapshotted as "already complete"
 * at the end of that pass, and those events would never start at all.
 * "SS Whore" (4.0) pins it: "Messenger Arrives After Sex" (event 9) and
 * "Oberst Drink Waiting" (event 8) are started by task 137, which only ever
 * runs as an execute-task action of task 261, the TaskAffected of event 12
 * (runner_probes/sswhore.run400.txt: the knock at the double doors after
 * `wait`).
 *
 * The Runner skips the loop when execute_action's flag argument is 0, which
 * happens only for the two library-internal dispatches in its take (47C747)
 * and drop (46FADB) handlers; every other path -- typed commands, events'
 * TaskAffected, nested execute-task actions, inventory -- passes 1.  That
 * corner is not modelled.  run380 and run390 have no such loop (checkevent
 * is called only from their events() pass and the finish recheck), so this
 * is gated on 4.0.

 *
 * Both Runners start a StarterType=1 event while the game is still loading,
 * BEFORE the first room description is printed -- probed live 2026-08-02 in
 * run400 (probe EV6 in test/adrift4/harness/make_arena_probe.py) and run390
 * (make_39_fwprobe.py variant "e"), a plain length-3 immediate event carrying
 * all three texts.  Two things follow, and both are visible:
 *
 *   - its LookText is part of the OPENING room description, because the event
 *     is already running when that description is composed;
 *   - its StartText is never seen at all, having been printed into the screen
 *     the intro then clears.
 *
 * Everything else about the event is unchanged, including when it ends: the
 * probe's length-3 event finished on the third command turn in both Runners
 * and in Scarier.  So this is purely a matter of moving the start earlier and
 * dropping its text -- hence the `silent` start here, and the +1 that leaves
 * the following startup tick's decrement landing on the rolled length.
 *
 * The finish half stays BELOW the description: a zero-length immediate event
 * prints its FinishText, runs its TaskAffected and (RestartType=1) restarts
 * with a visible StartText, all after the room text -- run400 probe EV5's
 * turn 0 reads "A bare arena.  H1 LOOK.  H2 LOOK.  H1 FINISH.  H1 TASK.  H1
 * START. ...".  Which is why this is two calls and not one.
