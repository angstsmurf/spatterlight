/*
 * The map: room boxes, the connectors between them, and a software rasteriser
 * that draws them.
 *
 * Both ADRIFT engines end up here, but they arrive from opposite directions.
 * In ADRIFT 5 the layout is authored data -- the Developer writes an
 * <Adventure><Map> of <Page>s of <Node>s, each carrying its own X/Y/Z -- so
 * the interpreter only has to read it (a5map.cpp).  ADRIFT 4 stores no
 * coordinates anywhere in the .taf; its runner derives a layout at run time,
 * walking the exit graph outwards from the player's room and shoving
 * already-placed rooms aside whenever two want the same cell.  We port that
 * algorithm rather than invent one (scmap.cpp).
 *
 * Once either engine has produced a map_t, almost everything below is common,
 * so a v4 map and a v5 map look alike in Spatterlight -- even though the
 * ADRIFT 4 runner's own map, built out of Visual Basic control arrays, looked
 * nothing like the ADRIFT 5 one.  Geometry follows the Adrift 5 runner's
 * Map.vb, whose plan view is the one a player sees unless they drag the map:
 * X to the right, Y downward, one map unit = `scale` pixels.  The one thing
 * that does not carry over is the shape of a connector, because a VB Line
 * control cannot bow: see map_s.line_links.
 *
 * This module is deliberately free of Glk and of both engines: it rasterises
 * into a plain RGB surface, so a map can be rendered and diffed headlessly
 * (test/adrift5/harness/a5map_dump.cpp).
