/*
 * run_hoist_verb_line()
 *
 * Every Runner matches its library verb ANYWHERE in the line, and Scarier
 * anchors most of it.  Every handler the input routine calls enters on c(<word>) --
 * the whole word, wherever it sits -- so a nonsense head changes nothing:
 * run400 answers `blorp take` "Take what?", `blorp take coin` "You take the
 * coin.", `blorp eat` "I don't understand what you are trying to eat.",
 * `blorp sit` "You sit down on the ground." and so on for twenty-nine of the
 * thirty-four verbs the probe types, though `blorp` is in no vocabulary.
 * (`search`, `wave` and `throw` are "I don't understand." because no arm
 * holds those words outside dobattle; `give` is the shape that shows the two
 * halves are separate, printing the "(to Nobody)" echo and then "Give
 * what?".)  Measured 2026-09-20 on p4REW with make_rewriteprobe.py, run400x
 * runner_probes/rew.run400.casc.txt.
 *
 * Scarier's table is anchored at the head, so the port is a rewrite rather
 * than a re-plumbing: hoist the verb to the front and let the ordinary rows
 * answer the line they already know.  The object half needs nothing -- the
 * 4.0 rows already bind their noun by score over the whole line, so `take
 * blorp coin` is already "You take the coin.".
 *
 * Below 4.0 the same is true, but only five handlers are still anchored in
 * Scarier: takes, drops, wears, removes and examines (HOIST_VERBS_PRE400
 * carries their words and the addresses).  Everything else already matches
 * its word anywhere, which is why `blorp drink`, `blorp push`, `blorp sit`
 * and `blorp read` already agreed.  run370x runner_probes/rew.run370.casc.rtf
 * and run380x runner_probes/rew.run380.casc.rtf answer `blorp take` "Take
 * what?", `blorp drop` "Drop what?", `blorp wear` "Wear what?", `blorp remove`
 * "Remove what?" and `blorp examine` "Nothing special."; run390x
 * runner_probes/rew.run390.casc.txt the same five.  What is left after the
 * hoist at those versions is the NOUN half -- `blorp take coin` is "You pick
 * up the coin." because takes()/drops() resolve with co() over the whole line,
 * where Scarier reads the text after the verb -- and run390's `blorp put`,
 * which answers "Give what?"; both are open leads.
 *
 * The hoist is deliberately narrow, and the narrowing is where the rule is
 * still owed:
 *
 *  - Nothing happens when the line's FIRST word is one of these verbs.  The
 *    anchored pass has already had that line and declined, so a hoist could
 *    only re-answer it, and every walkthrough line that starts with a verb
 *    is left exactly as it was.
 *  - Nothing happens when the line holds two or more of them: that is
 *    run_two_verb_line_400()'s business at 4.0 and
 *    lib_two_verb_line_pre400()'s below it, and whatever they decline is
 *    left exactly as it was.
 *
 * The word list is read straight out of the Runner: the literals each of
 * those procs hands to c() (Proc_21_38_454CB0) and to therest's verb helper
 * Proc_19_86_4455F8, in call order.  The particles those arms test as a
 * SECOND word are left out ("with", "about", "off", "on", "to", "from",
 * "all", "in"), as are the meta words the input routine answers itself
 * ("score", "wait", "turns", "version", "undo" -- `wait` is already matched
 * anywhere by run_wait_anywhere(), `score` by run_score_anywhere(), and the
 * sitstand words by lib_sitstand_anywhere()).  dobattle's verbs are in only
 * while the Battle System is on, which is the gate run400 puts on the call
 * itself (48A4A2).
 *
 * The list is kept one table per handler, in generaltasks' call order,
 * because run_two_verb_line_400() needs to know which handler a word
 * belongs to as well as that it is a verb.

 *
 * wears and removes write into the message without claiming, and their
 * refusals are guarded by an EMPTY buffer (run400 463B8B in front of
 * 463BBC), so the first of the two to write is the one that speaks; but
 * examines runs below them and overwrites unguarded, and therest never runs
 * at all once they have written (the 48AFE1 test is MemVar_4941B0 = "").
 * So the order that decides a line is
 *
 *     put/drop, take, examine, wear, remove, therest
 *
 * and WORD ORDER NEVER DECIDES: `take drop coin` and `drop take coin` are
 * both the drop.  Within therest the LAST arm the line names wins, that
 * cascade being one `If c(...)` after another each overwriting the message
 * before it -- `push pull coin` and `pull push coin` are both "You pull the
 * coin, but nothing happens.", `kick hit coin` and `hit kick coin` both the
 * hit.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-21 on p4REW (make_twoverbprobe.py, run400x
 * runner_probes/rew.run400.verb.txt) and on p4TWO
 * (runner_probes/two.run400.verb3.txt); the cells that carry the rule, coin
 * loose unless said otherwise:
 *
 *   `take drop coin`   "You are not holding the coin."   put_drop_list
 *   `drop take coin`   the same
 *   `examine take coin` (held) "You are already carrying the coin."
 *   `examine drop coin` "You are not holding the coin."
 *   `wear take coin`   (held) "You are already carrying the coin."
 *   `remove drop coin` "You are not holding the coin."

 *   `x get coin`       "You take the coin."
 *   `push take coin`   (held) "You are already carrying the coin."
 *   `push examine coin` "A gold coin."
 *   `wear examine`     "You see no such thing."   examines over "Wear what?"
 *   `take drop`        "Drop what?"
 *   `remove take hat`  "You take the hat."
 *   `x take off hat`   (worn) "You are already carrying the hat."
 *
 * Scarier answers a line from one anchored row, so the port is the same
 * re-spelling run_hoist_verb_line() does for a single verb: hoist the verb
 * whose handler the order leaves speaking to the front and leave the rest of
 * the line exactly as it stands, the other verb word included -- the winning
 * handler resolves its noun over the whole line too, which is why `wear
 * examine` has to become `examine wear` and not a bare `examine` (that would
 * trip examines' whole-line bare-verb exit at 471340).
 *
 * Narrow on purpose.  A list line ("all", "and") is left alone, as are the
 * claiming handlers whose place in the order is not measured (openclose,
 * give, whereis, gotoplace, characters, dobattle) and a `put` with no
 * container clause, whose branch at 46DC34 does not claim either -- see "A
 * put refusal silences the wear only where it CLAIMS" for what happens
 * there.  Two groups named by ONE word span ("take off" is get_outer's
 * `take` and removes' `take off`; "put on" is put_drop_list's `put` and
 * wears' `put on`) are not a two-verb line at all, and the spans have to
