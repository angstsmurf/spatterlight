 * word, it is cut at the first InStr "then" -- a substring, so `x athens
 * then look` runs "x a", "s" and "look" -- the head less one trailing
 * space, the tail less one leading space and run as the next command.
 * There is no comma and no ". " pass, so `x stone, look` is one command.
 * run390 (45EC8E-45F091) cuts at the first ",", then in what is left at the
 * first ". ", then -- if c("then") holds on that -- at the first "then",
 * each tail queued ahead of the rest and re-split when it is read back, so
 * the earliest surviving kind is the cut.  No Runner below 4.0 cuts at a

 *
 * c() (run370 423C80, run380 429048, run390 4334B0): the first InStr hit

/*
 * run_split_word_names_object()
 * run_find_split_400()
 *
 * 4.0's own input splitter.  run400 generaltasks calls Proc_19_60_459764
 * four times over, on "," then ". " then " and " then " then " (48A0DA,
 * 48A0E8, 48A0F6, 48A104), each pass working on what the pass before it
 * left, and each cut queueing its tail (MemVar_4942E4) to be read back as
 * the next command.  The catch is the loop at 459525: before it cuts, the
 * splitter takes the FIRST WORD of the tail (Proc_19_59_449980, leading
 * spaces stripped) and walks the whole object table, comparing that word
 * against every object's Short (field 4), every space-separated word of its
 * Prefix (field 0, Split on " ") and every one of its Aliases (field 8).  A
 * hit sends it round to look for the NEXT occurrence of the same separator
 * instead -- so a separator followed by something the game calls an object
 * is not a separator at all, and the line stays whole.
 *
 * That is what makes `get coin and hat` one command that takes both, while
 * `get coin and zzz` is two ("You take the coin." then the DontUnderstand
 * text); the same test covers commas, so `drop coin, hat` is one command
 * too.  The table walk has NO scope test -- an object two rooms away
 * suppresses just as well (`x hat and coin` typed in the empty second room
 * of the probe is one command) -- and the comparisons are VB's binary `=`,
 * so they are case-SENSITIVE against the already-lower-cased line: the
 * probe's alias "Widget" does NOT suppress the typed "widget", even though
 * the object resolver matches it.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-08 on the hand-built p4AND probe (make_400_andprobe.py;
 * Wine transcripts Adrift_955 and Adrift_956, 41 cells).  `x coin and hat
 * and zzz` cuts at the SECOND " and " (the first is suppressed by "hat");
 * `drop coin and hat, x box` cuts at the comma, the earliest cut of any
 * kind that survives suppression; `wave zzz and yyy` is cut in two and the
 * task named by the whole line never fires; `put coin in box and put hat in
 * desk` is cut ("put" is not an object) into two turns, where `put coin in
 * box and hat in desk` is one turn through put_drop_list's own clause loop
 * (lib_put_clauses_400).
 *
 * Pre-4.0 Runners split on far less and never consult the object table;
 * see run_find_split_pre400() above.
