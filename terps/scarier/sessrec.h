/*
 * Session records: the framing both ADRIFT engines use for the state a
 * Spatterlight autosave carries beyond the saved game -- the ADRIFT 4
 * session state (run_session_state() in runner/scrunner.cpp) and the
 * ADRIFT 5 parser continuation (a5run_pending_save() in adrift5/a5run.cpp).
 *
 * The encoding is a run of "<key> <length>\n<bytes>\n" records.  A value is
 * length-prefixed, so it may hold any bytes, newlines included.  Which keys
 * exist, and what an unknown or missing one means, is the caller's business:
 * this only writes a record and reads the next one back.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Glk and of both engines, and header-only, so that the
 * self-contained ADRIFT 5 harnesses pick it up without linking anything.
