# Deterministic ADRIFT-3.9/4.0 (SCARE-engine) walkthrough regression, modelled
# on test/run_a5_walkthroughs.sh (which does the same job for the ADRIFT-5 a5
# engine).  For each (solution, game) pair it runs the seeded headless `scare`
# binary over the solution script and strict-diffs the transcript against a
# committed golden.  A golden MATCH is the pass; an optional per-row win marker
# guards against a silently-desynced walkthrough being blessed as "passing"
# (see TODO_plover_walkthroughs.md §6/§7 -- Key & Compass scripts desync on the
# games' interactive "(Press a key)" pauses).
#
# Usage:
#   sh run_v4_walkthroughs.sh [substring]        # run + diff, table + exit code
#   sh run_v4_walkthroughs.sh --bless [substring] # (re)generate goldens
#   sh run_v4_walkthroughs.sh -v [substring]      # dump each failing diff
#
# A solution's golden is  harness/<solution-basename-sans-.txt>.expected.txt.
# Game .taf files are third-party data and are NOT committed (same policy as
# test/adrift5-games/): drop or symlink them into one of the GAMES dirs below,
# under the basename named in the MAP.  A row whose game is absent is SKIPped,
# a row whose solution is absent is NOSCRIPT -- neither fails the run.
#
# Env:
#   GAMES_DIR   primary game dir (default: harness/../games)
#   SCARE_DIR   engine sources for (re)building `scare` (default: terps/scarier)
# Determinism: the `scare` binary links seed.cpp (fixed RNG), so a given
# (game, solution) always yields the same transcript.
