/*
 * gsc_apply_known_game_assists()
 *
 * Hardcoded per-game assist defaults.  A few catalogued ADRIFT games are
 * unwinnable, or have whole goal chains unreachable, in the faithful Runner
 * behaviour because of the exact authoring accidents the opt-in assists were
 * written for.  Each row below was measured on the headless harness against
 * the game's walkthrough, with and without the assist (2026-09-26):
 *
 *  - Combat assist.  Every character's Accuracy and Agility left at 0, so
 *    under the 4.0 accuracy>agility hit test no attack ever lands.
 *    The Town of Azra (a 3.9 game upgraded to the 4.0 format) and The tunnels
 *    of Athylon cannot be won; in Enigma Creature every fight is an endless
 *    exchange of dodges, though the tasks around them still finish the game.
 *  - Move assist.  Move tasks whose "To:" combo was left unset, which the
 *    Runner ignores.  To hell & beyond (with combat too): the player never
 *    leaves the mansion.  The X-Files: A New Beginning: the move summoning
 *    Dean to his diner, so he and his conversation never appear.  HYPER
 *    Battle System: the move bringing the Flare Rat into the Attack Menu
 *    (cosmetic only -- the fight is driven by variables, not presence).
 *  - Repeat assist.  Pre-4.0 games where a finished task blocks a command
 *    the game needs again.  In The Long Journey Home and Inverness Castle a
 *    spent catch-all task answers every later command, even "quit", with
 *    "You have already done that."  The Vampire with a Conscience and The
 *    Merry Murders wall at 70/100 and 120/135 on the same class of bug, but
 *    each is a single bad field, so the patch table repairs them instead and
 *    they are not listed below: one notice, and no session-wide change to
 *    spent-task handling.  After "glk patches off" their walls are back, and
 *    "glk assist repeat on" is then the way past them.
 *  - Room assist.  A task left set to run in no room at all.  Space Run's
 *    ending is behind one; in The Hangover it is the doctor taking the fries
 *    (5/7 without, 6/7 with -- a separate bug still blocks the last point).
 *  - Capacity recompute.  Welcome to Wonderland: the characters' held
 *    objects phantom-weigh the ethereal knife past the player's limit in the
 *    4.0 running total, so the game's only weapon cannot be taken; with it
 *    and combat assist the game is won.
 *
 * Not listed, although their walkthrough rows once carried an assist: games
 * where it measured no difference (g7056, Ghoster, Noximion; combat in Space
 * Run) and Goldilocks, whose route the capacity switch breaks.  True
 * 3.9/3.8-signature games (e.g. Villains and Kings) are deliberately not
 * listed either: their combat is repaired unconditionally by the engine's
 * legacy hit model.
 *
 * For these known games the matching assists default to on, applied at game
 * start; "glk assist <name> off" still turns each one off, and a one-line notice is
 * printed at startup (see gsc_main).
 *
 * Games are recognised by the TAF's GameName and GameAuthor, compared
 * case-insensitively, so every release of a game is covered (the two known
 * Town of Azra releases differ only in CompileDate).  Author strings are the
 * TAF's raw Windows-1252 bytes.
