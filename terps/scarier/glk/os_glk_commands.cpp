 * gsc_command_assist()
 *
 * The optional assists, deliberately non-faithful aids for games broken by
 * their own data, switched as "glk assist <name> [on | off]":
 *
 *  - combat: amateur games that left every character's Accuracy and Agility
 *    unconfigured (0), so the 4.0 "accuracy > agility" hit test (0 > 0) never
 *    lands and combat stalemates forever.  Such fully-unconfigured games get
 *    an automatic hit, letting combat play out on the author's
 *    strength-vs-defence basis; games that do configure combat (e.g. Sun
 *    Empire) are never affected.
 *  - move: native-4.0 games authored with a move task action's "To:" combo
 *    left at VB's default -1 (the destination room sitting in Var3).  The
 *    Runner silently ignores such a move, which in e.g. To Hell & Beyond
 *    traps the player in the mansion; an unset move whose Var3 names a real
 *    room is honoured as "to room".
 *  - repeat: pre-4.0 games where a finished task claims a command the player
 *    needs again, answering "You have already done that." (or the task's
 *    RepeatText) ahead of movement and the library, which in e.g. The Long
 *    Journey Home and Inverness Castle blocks the only way on.  Those
 *    commands go on to the ordinary handlers; 4.0 games are unaffected.
 *  - room: a task whose Where room list was left set to no rooms at all,
 *    which the Runner can never run ("You can't do that here!"); such tasks
 *    may run in every room.
 *  - capacity: how the player's carried load is accounted for.  Off, Scarier
 *    mirrors the Runner's running total, updated on take and drop; on, it
 *    recomputes the load afresh from the objects held on each check (legacy
 *    SCARE behaviour).  Only run400 keeps a running total, so the switch
 *    bites only in a 4.0 game; see obj_uses_running_load().  It helps one
 *    known game and breaks another's route, so it is left unlisted: not
 *    offered in the synopsis or help, and reported only while it is on.
 *
 * All are off by default, and switched on per game at startup by the
 * known-game table in os_glk.cpp.  Each was once a command of its own, and
 * the old names -- combatassist, moveassist, repeatassist, roomassist and
 * capacity -- remain as aliases.
