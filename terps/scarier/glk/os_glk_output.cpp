 * Adrift text colours ("glk colour").
 *
 * Adrift games are written for a Runner that paints its output pane in a
 * palette rather than in the interpreter's theme: a background, an "output"
 * (replies) colour for the story, and an "input" (typed) colour that <c>...</c>
 * also asks for, on top of whatever <font colour="..."> the text names.  Glk
 * has no colour of its own, so by default this port drops all of that and
 * shows the story in the interpreter's styles, as SCARE always has.
 *
 * "glk colour on" turns the palette back on, through the Gargoyle/Spatterlight
 * garglk_set_zcolors extension.  Where that extension is missing (cheapglk,
 * glkterm) the mode cannot be offered at all, so everything below compiles out
 * and the command says so.
 *
 * A game that cannot be read without the palette -- an ADRIFT 5 adventure that
 * set colours of its own, or text that paints a background or names a colour
 * too close to the interpreter's to see -- turns the mode on for itself at load
 * time, before a word is printed; gsc_colour_detect is what asks.
 *
 * Where the palette comes from differs by engine.  ADRIFT 5 stores it in the
 * adventure itself (a5model.h bg_colour and friends).  ADRIFT <=4 stores none:
 * the .taf has no colour fields, and the colours are Runner preferences.  The
 * defaults below are the ones run400.exe ships, read out of the settings it
 * writes under HKCU\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\ADRIFT\Runner:
 * Background 0, Text1 3289855 and Text2 65280 -- OLE colour integers (low byte
 * red), i.e. black, #FF3232 for typed text and #00FF00 for replies.  They match
 * the swatches in the Runner's own Options -> Display & Media dialog ("Set
 * typed colour", "Set replies colour", "Set background colour").
