Copy the appropriate Makefile for your operating system to 'Makefile' in both
this directory and the 'glkterm' directory and type 'make install'. 
This will compile the interpreters relevant to your system and the 'bjorb' 
utility then move the binaries to ../bin. 

See the Installation chapter in the Author's Guide (../guide/installation.html) 
for more information.

The interpreters available to be built are:

jacl    - compiled with Andrew Plotkin's GlkTerm and either Ncurses or PDCurses.
cjacl   - compiled with Andrew Plotkin's CheapGlk. 
garjacl - compiled with Tor Andersson/ Ben Cressey's Gargoyle. 
winjacl - compiled with David Kinder's WinGlk (requires MinGW to be built).
