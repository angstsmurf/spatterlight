Name
  tcgdum.c - stub for tcg routines
Function
  Provides link-time resolution of tcg symbols
Notes
  These routines do nothing; they are merely to allow linking the
  normal TADS/Compiler without having to have separate drivers for
  the graphical and non-graphical versions.
Modified
  04/11/99 CNebel        - Improve const-ness; use new headers.
  12/16/92 MJRoberts     - creation
