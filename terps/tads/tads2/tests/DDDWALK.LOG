   You wake up to the sound of voices in the hall.  You are confused for a
moment; it's only 8 AM, far too early for anyone to be getting up.  Then, it
dawns on you:  it's ditch day here at the fictitious California Institute of
Technology in the mythical city of Pasadena, California.  Ditch Day, that
strange tradition wherein seniors bar their doors with various devices and
underclassmen attempt to defeat these devices (for no other apparent reason
than that the devices are there), has arrived.

Room 3
   This is your room.  You live a fairly austere life, being a poor college
student.  The only notable features are the bed (unmade, of course) and a small
wooden desk.  An exit is west.
   You see a waste basket here.

You find a dollar bill!  You pocket the bill.  (Okay, so it's an obvious
adventure game puzzle, but I'm sure you would have been disappointed if nothing
had been there.)

Alley One
   You are in the eternal twilight of Alley One, one of the twisty little
passages (all different) making up the student house in which you live.  Your
room (room 3) is to the east.  To the west is a door (closed), affixed to which
is a large sign.  An exit is south, and the hallway continues north.

Breezeway
   You are in a short passage that connects a courtyard, to the east, to the
outside of the building, which lies to the west.  A hallway leads north.

Quad
   You are on the quad, a large grassy square in the center of campus.  The
bookstore lies to the northwest; the health center lies to the northeast;
Buildings and Grounds lies to the north; and walkways lead west and south.
   Some students dressed in radiation suits are staging a bogus toxic leak,
undoubtedly to fulfill the requirements of one of the stacks.  They are
wandering around, looking very busy.  Many reporters are standing at a safe
distance, looking terrified.  The supposed clean-up crew is pouring lots of
liquid nitrogen onto the ground, resulting in huge clouds of water vapor.
   You see a flask here.  The flask seems to contain some liquid nitrogen.

Laundry Room
   You are in the laundry room.  There is a washing machine against one wall. 
The exit is to the south.

Opening the washing machine reveals a blue jeans.

It looks like an ordinary pair of jeans, though not your size.  As you inspect
them, you notice a key fall out of them and to the ground.

*Some* adventure games would try to impose their authors' misguided sense of
ethics on you at this point, telling you that you don't feel like picking up
the key, or you don't have time to do that, or that it's against the rules to
even possess a master key, much less steal one from some other student's pants
that you happened to find in a laundry, or even more likely that you are unable
to take the key while wearing that dress.  However, you're the player, and
you're in charge around here, so I'll let you make your own judgments about
what's ethical and proper here...  Taken.

Hallway
   You are at the east end of a basement hallway.  To the north is a "storage
room," which everyone knows is actually an entrance to the steam tunnels.

Storage Room
   You are in a large storage room.  There really hasn't been anything stored
here for a long time (at least, not anything that anybody wants to ever see
again).  The exit is to the south.  To the north lies a door, which is closed. 
A small card table is sitting in front of the door.
   Sitting on the card table is an empty glass.
   A guard is sitting at the card table in front of the door.  He watches you
carefully, evidently thinking that you might be planning to try to go through
the door.

The guard eyes you warily.

The guard happily accepts your offer; "ToxiCola!  My favorite!"  he says
appreciatively, not knowing the evil deed that you have in mind.  He quickly
drinks the entire cup of ToxiCola.  "Wow!  Just the caffeine pickup I needed,"
he says happily.
   After a few moments, though, he looks rather queasy.  "That caffeine just
doesn't last long enough," he says just before he passes out, slumping over the
card table.

Unlocked.

Opened.

Steam Tunnel
   You are in a steam tunnel.  It is very hot and dry in here.  The place has a
strange musty odor; the air is very still, but there are distant sounds of all
sorts that vibrate through the pipes.  The pipes all seem to be hissing
quietly, and a low rumbling sound constantly reverberates through the tunnel. 
Occasionally a distant clang or thud or crack emanates from the pipes.
   The steam tunnel runs east and west.  A small passage leads south.

The rumbling sound suddenly becomes very loud, then, after a few moments, dies
down to background levels again.

Steam Tunnel
   You are in an east-west section of the steam tunnel.  A very small passage
between some steam pipes leads north, but it would be a tight squeeze.

You lay down on one of the pipes and start to snake through the passage.  For a
moment, you think you're stuck, but you manage to wriggle your way through. 
You emerge on the north side of the narrow crawl.

Steam Tunnel
   You are in another steam tunnel, but this one is substantially different
from the tunnels you have been in so far.  This tunnel is much wider, less
cluttered; it looks like it was built more recently than the south tunnels. 
The tunnel itself runs east and west, and passing back to the south is
evidently possible, given your presence here.

A loud buzzing sound, like an overloaded electrical circuit, emanates from
somewhere nearby.  After a few moments it is gone.

   You are in a large open area in the steam tunnels.  In the center of the
room is a large pit, around which is a protective railing.  A steam tunnel is
to the east.

You tie one end of the rope to the railing, and lower the other end into the
pit.  It appears to extend to the bottom of the pit.

You climb down the rope...

Huge Cavern
   You are in a huge and obviously artificial cavern.  The cave has apparently
been dug out over a long period of time; some parts look very old, and other
areas look comparatively recent.  A small bronze plaque affixed to one of the
older walls reads, "Great Undergraduate Excavation - 1982."  From high above, a
small opening in the ceiling casts a dim glow over the vast chamber.  A rope
extends from the opening above.  Passages of various ages lead north, south,
east, west, southeast, and southwest.

   You are in the Biology Lab.  All sorts of strange equipment is scattered
around the room.  A lab bench is in the center of the room, and on one wall is
a cabinet (which is closed).  A passage leads north.
   Sitting on the lab bench is a funnel and a CloneMaster.

   You are at the east end of an east-west hallway.  A doorway leads east.
   An enormous creature is blocking the hallway to the east.  He (please don't
press for details as to how you know, but "he" is the appropriate pronoun here)
appears to be part human, but exactly what part is not clear.  The creature's
leathery skin is a bright green, and is largely covered with a thick
transluscent slime.

The creature looks at you warily.

The creature grabs you and pushes you back, depositing a huge glob of slime on
you in the process.

The creature growls at you, showing his enormous pointy fangs.

The CloneMaster clicks and whirs for several seconds.  A monstrous female
version (again, don't ask how you know it's female) leaps from the tiny
machine.  The two monsters look at each other with passion in their mutant
eyes.  They run to each other with open arms, seemingly in slow motion.  They
embrace, engage in some mushy behavior, and then run away together to elope.

Dropped.

Tunnel
   You're in a north-south tunnel.  The tunnel slopes steeply downward to the
north.

Subway Station
   You're in a very large musty chamber deep underground.  In the center of the
room is a small rail car.  Strangely, the car is sitting on the floor; there
are no rails under the car, or, indeed, in the station at all.  You look
around, and notice about three meters up the east wall is a round tunnel.  A
passage leads south.

Okay, you're now in the rail car.

A perfect fit!

You carefully pour the liquid nitrogen into the funnel.  It doesn't take very
much before the tank is full.

>push green button.z.z.z.z.exit
A low-frequency hum sounds from within the railcar.  After a few moments, it
starts to levitate off the track.

The car rises to about three meters off the floor.  It then starts to
accelerate toward the tunnel, and plunges into the tunnel with a rush of air.

Insurance Office
   You are in an insurance office.  Like most insurance offices, the area is
rather non-descript.  The exit is northeast.
   As you walk into the office, a large metallic robot, very much like the
traditional sci-fi film robot, but wearing a dark polyester business suit, zips
up to you.  "Hi, I'm Lloyd the Friendly Insurance Robot," he says in a
mechanical British accent.  "You look like you could use some insurance!  Here,
let me prepare a policy for you."
   Lloyd scurries around the room, gathering papers and studying charts,
occasionally zipping up next to you and measuring your height and other
dimensions, making all kinds of notes, and generally scampering about.  After a
few minutes, he comes up to you, showing you a piece of paper.
   "I have the perfect policy for you.  Just one dollar will buy you a hundred
thousand worth of insurance!"  He watches you anxiously.
   Lloyd is here, offering you an insurance policy for only one dollar.

Lloyd watches you expectantly, hoping you will buy the insurance policy.

Lloyd graciously accepts the payment, and hands you a copy of your policy. 
"You might wonder how we keep costs so low," Lloyd says.  "It's simple:  we're
highly automated, which keeps labor costs low; I run the whole company, which
keeps the bureaucratic overhead low; and, most importantly, I follow you
everywhere you go for the duration of the policy, ensuring that you're paid on
the spot should anything happen, which means we don't have to waste money
investigating claims!"

Lloyd gets out some actuarial tables and does some computations.

Huge Cavern

Lloyd follows you.

Machine Shop
   You are in the machine shop.  It appears that this huge chamber was once
used to build and maintain the equipment that was used to create the Great
Undergraduate Excavation.  Though most of the equipment is gone now, one very
large and strange machine dominates the center of the room.  The exit is east,
and a small passage leads north.

Lloyd follows you.

As you push the button, the machine starts making horrible noises and flinging
huge metal rods in all directions.  Enormous clouds of smoke rise from the
machine as it flails about.  After a few minutes of this behavior, you think to
step back from the machine.  You're not fast enough, though; before you can
escape it, a stray metal bar flings itself against your thumb, creating a
sensation not unlike intense pain.
   Lloyd rolls over and looks at your thumb.  "That looks awful," he says as
you jump about, holding your thumb.  Lloyd produces a thick pile of paper and
starts leafing through it.  "Temporary loss of use of one thumb...  ah, yes,
here it is.  That injury pays five dollars."  Lloyd puts away his papers and
produces a crisp new five dollar bill, which you accept (with your other hand).

Lloyd checks the area to make sure it's safe.

   You are in a small room, with exits north and south.  The passage to the
north has a small sign reading "Behavior Lab Maze"; the room is filled with
strange equipment, which you surmise is connected in some way to the maze.
   You sigh in resignation as you realize that you have reached the obligatory
Adventure Game Maze, and wonder what this maze's unique twist will be.  Surely,
it won't just be a boring old labyrinth...

has been bought up by seniors in attempts to build their stacks and
underclassmen in attempts to break them.  The exit is to the southeast.

giving his insurance pitch.  After a moment, he notices the guard is
unconscious.  "It's just as well," Lloyd confides; "security work is awfully
risky, and his rates would have been quite high."

down to background levels again.

A series of clanking noises, like marbles rolling through the steam pipes,
starts in the distance, then comes closer and closer, until it seems to pass
right overhead.  It disappears into the distance.

flask:  You put the flask into the chute, and it slides away into the darkness.
After a few moments, you hear a soft thud.

and it slides away into the darkness.  After a few moments, you hear a soft

You lay down on one of the pipes and start to snake through the passage.  For a
moment, you think you're stuck, but you manage to wriggle your way through. 
You emerge on the north side of the narrow crawl.

Somehow, Lloyd manages to squeeze through the crawl.

Chute Room
   You see a master key, a flask, a Great Seal of the Omega, a DarbCard, a
book, an insurance policy, and a flashlight here.  The flask seems to contain
some liquid nitrogen.  The flashlight seems to contain a battery.

Lloyd follows you.

Great Seal of the Omega:  Taken.
DarbCard:  Taken.
book:  Taken.
flashlight:  Taken.

   You are in a small storage closet off the machine shop.  The exit is south.
   You see Mr. Happy Gear here.

Lloyd follows you.  When he sees the apparent radioactive waste spill, he is
quite alarmed.  After a moment, though, he deduces that the spill is a staged
part of the Ditch Day festivities, and he calms down.

book:  The book disappears into the slot.

Mr. Happy Gear:  Mr. Happy Gear disappears into the slot.
Great Seal of the Omega:  The Great Seal of the Omega disappears into the slot.
As the treasure disappears into the slot, you hear a klaxon from the other side
of the door.  An elaborate series of clicks and clanks follows, then the door
swings open.

Lloyd watches attentively to make sure you don't hurt yourself.

Room 4
   This is room 4, where the weird senior across the hall lives.  An exit is to
the east, and a strange passage leads down.
   You see a note and a warp motivator here.

Lloyd follows you.

Taken.

Lloyd gets out some actuarial tables and does some computations.

The passage takes you down a winding stairway to a previously unseen entrance
to...

Spaceship Room
   This is a very large cave dominated by a tall spaceship.  High above, a
vertical tunnel leads upward; it is evidently a launch tube for the spaceship. 
The exit is north.

Lloyd follows you.

It fits snugly.

Lloyd checks the area to make sure it's safe.

Spaceship
   You are in the cockpit of the spaceship.  The control panel is quite simple;
the only feature that interests you at the moment is a button labelled
"Launch."

Lloyd follows you.

The ship's engines start to come to life.  "Launch sequence engaged," the
mechanical computer voice announces.
   Lloyd heads for the door.  "Sorry," he says, "I can't go with you.  Your
policy specifically excludes coverage during missions in deep space, and,
frankly, it's too risky for my tastes.  Besides, I don't appear in 'Deep Space
Drifter.'"  Lloyd waves goodbye, and rolls out of the spaceship.
   The hatch closes automatically, sealing you into the space vessel.  The
engines become louder and louder.  The computer voice announces, "Launch in
five...  four...  three...  two...  one...  liftoff!"  The engines blast the
ship into orbit.
   You realize that the time has come to set course for "Deep Space Drifter,"
another fine TADS adventure from High Energy Software.

In a total of 221 turns, you have achieved a score of 80 points out of a
possible 80, which gives you a rank of graduate.

Thanks for participating in Ditch Day!
