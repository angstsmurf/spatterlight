


It was a more exciting time, back in the early years of deep space exploration.
Anyone who could afford a good ship and a tank full of fuel could strike out
into the vast empty reaches to find his fortune among the stars.

Of course, you'd have a better chance of finding your fortune if you had
remembered to check a nav chart before heading off into the void.  Now you're
nearly out of fuel and air, you're tired and hungry -- and desperately hoping
you can find someone monitoring the distress channels.

Spaceship, in the pilot's seat
   You are securely belted into the pilot's seat of your trusty spaceship.  A
console occupies the north wall.  The hatch to the west is closed.

A tinny metallic voice announces, "Distress signal activated.  Stand by."

Time passes...

Time passes...

Time passes...

Your computer's tinny voice announces, "Now receiving incoming message."  A
three dimensional image of a woman appears.  She is striking, but she looks
very tired and distraught.  "Hello," she says, "I'm receiving your distress
signal.  I'm on Space Station K-7, which is in orbit of the planet nearest your
position.  Do you have enough fuel to get here?"  Suddenly, the room behind her
seems to shake, and the picture dissolves into static.  After a moment, the
picture returns; the woman is nervously typing something on a control panel. 
"Look," she says, "I probably won't be here when you get here.  You should try
to make your repairs and leave as soon as you can.  We're --" the picture
dissolves into static again, and doesn't return for several moments.  "-- my
autonav code now.  Are you receiving?"  The picture breaks up into static.  The
computer voice comes back on.  "Receiving autonav signal on bearing 5381. 
Video channel closed."

The computer's voice announces, "Autonav now engaged.  Stand by."  The ship
shudders briefly as the engines come on to turn the vessel on its new course. 
You just hope there's enough fuel to get you there.

Time passes...

(the seat belt)
Okay, the seat belt is now unfastened.

You're feeling a bit peckish.  Perhaps it would be a good time to find
something to eat.

Okay, you're no longer in the pilot's seat.

A sudden shock reverberates through your ship.  "Warning," the ship's computer
announces, "near miss by energy beam weapon."  You hold on, hoping it doesn't
get any closer, knowing there's not anything you can do with so little fuel.
   Your ship shudders for a moment as the rockets suddenly fire.  The rockets
stop, and a few moments later a loud thud resounds throughout the ship. 
"Docking completed," the tinny computer voice announces.

Opened.

East Gangway
   You are in a short passage.  An indicator light next to the open hatch to
the east is green.  The station is to the west.

You're feeling a bit drowsy; you should find a comfortable place to sleep.

Docking Bay
   You are in the main dock of the space station.  There are gangways to the
north, east, and south.  A corridor leads west, and a stairway leads up.
   You see a fuel cell box here.

Main Room
   You are in the main room of the space station, which apparently serves as a
lounge and recreation room; a chair and a couch are facing a tri-V.  There is a
kitchen to the north.  Hallways lead east and west, there are doors to the
southeast and southwest, and a spiral staircase leads up and down.
   Sitting on the couch is a remote control.

You're feeling a bit peckish.  Perhaps it would be a good time to find
something to eat.

Under the cushion you find a shiny metal key, which you take.

The station shakes slightly, as though some large object hit the exterior.

Taken.

>lie on couch.sleep.n.n.
Okay, you're now lying on the couch.

You quickly drift off into dreamland...


You are in a strange swamp.  A plant with gaping jaws is here, holding an odd
balloon creature in its maw.
   You notice the plant has a red spot near its base.  You're not sure why, but
you feel compelled to walk over to the plant and touch the spot.  As you do,
the plant seems to be tickled by it, and in the foliage equivalent of a sneeze,
shoots the balloon creature high into the air to the north.

In the swamp
   You're in a large, foul swamp.  It looks like you might be able to travel to
the north.
   In front of you is a large and strange plant.  It stands about six feet
high, and has a red spot near its base.  The top of the plant opens into huge
jaws that could easily hold a human.

You wade northwards into the swamp.  You shortly come across another plant.
   Suddenly, from the muck, a huge and terrifying brown spiny-beaked pin-headed
swamp weasel emerges.  The beast starts coming your way; you try to run, but
cannot!  Just as you're sure there's no escape, the beast halts and looks up. 
After a moment, you hear a whistling sound, like something falling from high
above.  You look up to see the strange balloon creature falling from the south.
   The beast looks more terrified than you, and runs away whimpering to the
north.  You try to run for cover yourself, but before you can move, the balloon
lands in the open jaws of the plant.
   Once again, you feel compelled to touch the plant's red spot, and once
again, the plant ejects the balloon to the east.

In the swamp
   You're in a large, foul swamp.  It looks like you might be able to travel to
the north.
   In front of you is a large and strange plant.  It stands about six feet
high, and has a red spot near its base.  The top of the plant opens into huge
jaws that could easily hold a human.


There's a brown spiny-beaked pin-headed swamp weasel here!  You reel in terror,
but before you've had a chance to do anything, another beast enters from the
south.  The two swamp weasels suddenly see each other, and look even more
startled and terrified than you do (which is quite a trick).  With remarkable
agility, the first beast leaps straight into the air.  It lands in the gaping
jaws of the plant.  The second turns around as fast as it can and heads back
the way it came.

   You feel compelled to approach the plant, even with the fierce beast in its
jaws.  You timidly reach out and touch the spot.  As you do, the plant starts
to convulse wildly; after a few moments, it spits the swamp weasel high into
the air to the west.

You realize it was only a dream.  You wake up refreshed.

The robot stops dead in its tracks, shuts off the vacuum and drops it to the
floor.  The robot then powers down, slumping over into an inanimate pile.

Kitchen
   You are in a kitchen.  There is a microwave oven here (closed), next to a
large refrigerator (closed).  There is also a set of plastic shelves here.  To
the south is the main room of the station.

A loud crashing sound explodes all around you.  The whole room shakes violently
for several moments.  The shaking eventually subsides.

Opening the refigerator reveals a bologna sandwich and a ham sandwich.

That was delicious!

Bedroom
   You are in a bedroom.  A desk is against one wall, and a bed is in the
center of the room.  Doors lead to the north and west.

A terrifying roar suddenly rips through the station, as though a huge explosion
had just happened nearby.  The floor buckles and the room seems to spin.  For
long moments, the room rumbles and shakes.  Eventually, the shaking subsides,
and you take a moment to regain your balance.

Control Room
   You are in the station control room.  A large picture window covers one
whole wall, offering a breathtaking view of the planet above.  There is a
control panel here, consisting of little more than a keyboard and display
screen.  A log reader is sitting on the control panel.
   You see a power supply here.  Sitting on the control panel is a square of
yellow plastic and a square of red plastic.

button:  The voice of the woman you spoke to earlier comes from the log reader.
"Day 223.  I don't know what's going on around here, but it seems like
everything is getting lost.  This place only has about a dozen rooms and I
can't find my hairdrier in any of them."
button:  "Day 225.  I'm sure Pinback is hiding things on me.  It's the only
explanation of how a half-ton maintenance robot can disappear on a station this
size.  He knew I was going to have it vacuum today, so he hid it on me.  That
man is getting very weird."
button:  "Day 226.  Okay, so we're all getting a little cabin fever here. 
Pinback says he just took the maintenance robot down to the surface to set up
the new landing pad.  I guess I was kind of mean to him about the whole deal."
button:  "Day 228.  The stupid robot isn't back yet.  I don't know what
Pinback's up to, but he's sure not telling me whatever it is."
button:  "Day 229.  Half the power supplies in the place just up and
disappeared last night!  Pinback says he doesn't have any idea where they went.
I can't even use the telescope and the log writer at the same time now!"
button:  "Day 230.  I think there's only one power supply on board now, not
counting those that Pinback's hiding wherever he's hiding them.  I'm keeping
this one with me all the time from now on.  Pinback tried to trick me into
giving it to him so he could fill the air tanks.  He said something about going
outside to replace the fuse again.  Stupid thing's blowing every couple of
trips down, he claims."
button:  "Day 230.  While Pinback was down on the planet today I searched his
room to see if I could find any of the stuff I thought he'd hidden.  I didn't
find anything, so I pointed the telescope straight down at the landing pad. 
There he was, unloading a big heap of equipment.  He's trying to drive me
crazy, I just know it.  He keeps saying these obscure things about 'when he's
in charge.'"
button:  "Day 232.  That maniac Pinback tied me up and drugged me for the last
two days!  I managed to free myself while he was down on the surface.  I think
he's becoming dangerous.  I've got to do something about it.
button:  "Day 232.  I think I know what Pinback's doing.  He's trying to get
the old laser cannon on the planet working.  Somehow he thinks that it will
make him powerful.  He's started calling himself 'Lord Pinback.'  The man has
seriously lost it."  The log reader pauses for a moment, then rewinds the tape
to the beginning.

button:  A man's voice comes from the machine:  "Day 219.  Tram 1 completely
malfunctioned.  I'm looking in the manual, but I'm probably going to have to
get a repairman out here."
button:  The man's voice continues, "Day 220.  Fixed tram.  It was the fuse
again.  Our supply of fuses is now completely exhausted.  I'm going to have to
risk going down to the planet today to scout the new landing site at
coordinates 1701."
button:  The man's voice continues, "Day 222.  No report."
button:  The man's voice says, "Day 223.  Sigourney has asked me to enter into
the log that her hairdrier has disappeared.  I'm sure headquarters will be on
this one right away, Sigourney."
button:  A woman's voice continues the log report.  You quickly recognize it as
the woman you spoke to earlier.  "Day 225.  The maintenance robot has
disappeared."
button:  The man's voice comes on again, sounding irate.  "Day 225.  Disregard
previous entry.  The maintenance robot is simply down on the surface preparing
the new landing site at 1701."
button:  The woman's voice comes on again.  "Day 227.  So where's the robot,
Pinback?"
button:  The man's voice continues.  "Day 227.  I'm having serious concerns
about Sigourney's mental health.  She seems overly upset about small, everyday
problems--" The woman's voice, now quite hysterical, cuts in.  "What do you
mean, concerns about my mental health, you little jerk?  Everything's just
disappearing and you call that--" The man's voice cuts back in:  "Now,
Sigourney, just calm down.  If you'd let me finish, I'd have told you that the
robot is broken, so I couldn't get it in the tram to--" The woman's voice
again:  "Broken?  What could you have done to it to break it?"  The man's
voice:  "Probably the fuse or something.  Look, let's just turn this off--"
button:  The man's voice continues.  "Day 230.  I had to restrain Sigourney
since she appears to be having a breakdown."
button:  The man continues, "Day 231.  Sigourney's condition appears to be
getting worse the longer she is restrained.  The sedatives are helping.  I
hesitate to inform headquarters, because I think this is a temporary condition
she'll get over."
button:  The woman's voice, calm but angry, continues.  "Day 232.  Pinback has
gone mad.  He's trying to reactivate the old military base on the planet.  He
has some kind of crazy plan that it will let him rule the galaxy.  I have to
stop him before he actually manages to find any weapons down there and hurts
himself."
button:  The log reader pauses, then rewinds itself.

A terrifying roar suddenly rips through the station, as though a huge explosion

Airlock
   You are in an airlock.  The door to the east is closed, and an open door to
the west leads into the station.  A large red button on the wall reads "Cycle".

You hear a mechanical voice state, "Warning:  airlock cycle ready.  Check your
suit and press cycle button again when ready to depressurize."

The door to the west slides shut, and you hear a rush of air.  Soon the sound
fades, and then is gone altogether, and you realize that the chamber is now a
high vacuum.  The east door slides open.

The spacesuit's headlamp goes on, emitting its full 200 Watt glow.

Outside Airlock
   You are standing on the space station's hull, to the east of an airlock
(whose door is open).  The vast dark bulk of the solar collectors hangs above
you, blocking out the sun.  Handholds lead away to the north, south, and east.

There is a brilliant flash of light, and the station shakes violently.  You
don't know how, but somehow you manage to avoid floating out into space.  After
a few moments, the shaking stops.

On space station's hull
   You're on the space station's hull.  Solar reflectors above capture all of
the sunlight and planetlight that might otherwise be illuminating this area. 
Handholds go off to the north; to the south is the roof of a small tram ship.

Tram
   You are in a TripMaster 2000 (tm), the top of the line station to surface
tram.  There is an open hatch to the north, a viewport to the south, and
beneath the viewport is a control console.  There are two seats here, one for
the pilot and the other for a passenger.  A short power cord is near the base
of the console.

Okay, the pilot's seatbelt is now fastened.

The hatch slides shut and latches.  With a lurch, the tram separates from the
station and floats slowly away.

Time passes...

The retros fire gently.  The tram slowly loses its orbital velocity, and starts
to fall toward the planet.
   Through your viewport, you see a giant beam of energy from the planet, which
seems to be aimed directly at your tram!  After a moment, though, you realize
that the beam is just missing your tram.  It is, however, directly hitting the
space station.  A huge shower of sparks and bits of material fly away from the
station.  Suddenly, the entire station explodes in a tremendous but strangely
silent fireball.  After a few moments, you hear a tapping sound as chunks of
material from the explosion hit your tram.

Time passes...

Through the viewscreen you can see nothing more than the bright red of
incandescing air as the tram plunges into the atmosphere.  As the outer shell
of the tram heats up, the turbulence increases, shaking the tram like a
demented baby's rattle.  Luckily you are securely buckeled in, and ride out
this part of the trip feeling only slightly nauseous.

Time passes...

The tram starts firing its landing rockets.

Time passes...

The tram gently settles onto the ground.  The motors slowly power down.

Okay, the pilot's seatbelt is now unfastened.

The hatch slides open.  Outside, you hear giggling.  You peer cautiously
through the door.  You see a man standing on the launch pad, looking up at the
sky, rubbing his hands together, cackling with glee.  Overhead, a meteor shower
of debris from the destroyed space station is slowly streaming through the
upper atmosphere.
   "She can't stop me now," the man cackles to himself.  "Lord Pinback, Emperor
of the Galaxy!"  He picks up a power supply that was sitting on the ground next
to him, and wanders off into the distance.

Okay, you're no longer in the pilot's seat.

South Landing Pad
   You are standing on a large landing pad.  To the south is your trusty tram. 
A walkway leads west, and a passageway leads north.

Walkway
   You are on a walkway between the east landing pad (to the east) and a large
dome to the west.

Quarters Entry
   You are in the entryway to a large dome, which provides housing to the
base's many occupants.  A walkway exits to the east; a large room lies to the
west.

Common Room
   This is the common room for the base's quarters.  Exits lie east, west,
north, and south.

Hall
   You are in a north-south hall.  A doorway leads west; it is marked
"Private."

Small Room
   You're in a small room.  A doorway to the east leads outside, and a small
passage leads west.
   A large domestic robot is here.  It stands blocking the passage to the west,
eying you suspiciously.  From the looks of it, the robot is running GuardMaster
2000(tm) security software.

The robot starts moving through the room, vacuuming and tidying up.  After it
has dusted everything in sight, it moves off to the west.  You hear terrible
crashes and explosions and laserblasts and bangs, but you still hear the vacuum
cleaner whining annoyingly.  Finally, a huge explosion resounds through the
chamber, and the vacuuming ceases.

>w.w.get unit.flip alarm
Gauntlet
   You are in a very long hallway running east and west.  The walls, floor, and
ceiling are lined with a vast array of terrible-looking weapons, certainly
designed to keep this corridoor safe from intruders.
   The shattered remains of a destroyed robot litter the floor.
   The huge array of weapons makes a half-hearted attempt to track you through
the corridoor, but the battle with the robot apparently left it with
insufficient energy to do you any harm.  However, you can hear the sound of
power supplies rapidly charging up, so you feel as though you should move
quickly away from here.

Commander's Quarters
   You are in a richly appointed room, which obviously serves as the
commander's quarters.  An exit is to the east.
   You see a yellow note and a portable control unit here.

The shuttle emerges into a gigantic hub, where dozens of tubes come together. 
The basically cubic enclosure, hundreds of meters on a side, has walls to the
north, east, south, and west, and each wall has a three-by-three grid of tubes
entering it.

You give the ripcord a good tug, and it comes free of its socket.  For a moment
you think it might have been defective, but suddenly, all around the rim of the
canopy, huge explosive charges ignite with a deafening roar and a blinding
flash of light.  The shuttle is momentarily filled with a cloud of thick,
black, sulfurous smoke.  After a while, the smoke dissipates, and you see that
the canopy hasn't been so much ejected as blown to bits.  You wonder for a
moment how you survived the explosion, much less escaped serious injury.

The shuttle emerges into a depot and comes to a stop.

Reactor Depot
   This is the shuttle depot serving the reactor center.  A passageway leads
west.

Reactor Control
   This is the reactor control room.  A passageway leads east.  To the south is
a monstrous steel door, which is very securely closed.
   The reactor controls are quite complex; only a few features make much sense
to you.  On the wall is the Big Board, which has colored lights that indicate
reactor status.  A large console has many strange controls that you could not
even begin to understand; the only controls that look approachable are four
buttons labelled 1, 2, 3, and 4.

As you descend, you are startled to see a man in the cave below.  It's Pinback!
Before you can turn around, he comes up to you, wielding a large gun.  "So, you
thought you could lose me in these caves?  No such luck!"  He laughs; no,
actually, he giggles, to be precise.  "I don't know what you think you're doing
out here, but whatever it is, you're not going to stop me!  I'm going to be
Lord Pinback, Emperor of the Known Universe!"  He giggles at length, but his
aim does not waver.
   In the distance, you hear a familiar rumbling sound.  Pinback doesn't seem
to notice.  He goes on talking and giggling.  "Lord Pinback...  perhaps it is
not sufficiently majestic a title for one so powerful as myself.  King Pinback?
Prince Pinback?  Sir Pinback?  Baron von Pinback?"  He goes on and on and on,
and all the while the rumbling sound grows nearer.
   Suddenly, Pinback notices the approaching water.  He looks away for a
moment; you take the chance to escape back to the higher ground.  Below, the
water rushes through the cave; you hear Pinback's maniacal laughter as he is
swept away into the distance.

Air Vent
   You are in an airvent.  To the south, the airvent has collapsed.  Evidently,
this airvent is suspended over the huge shuttle hub; the gaping hole to the
south affords you a spectacular overhead view of the vast chamber below, but
also provides a dangerous precipice.  The vent continues to the north.
   An empty shuttle is maneuvering below.  It is currently just east of you.

In the hub below, you can see a shuttle maneuvering.  It is currently directly
below you.

You gather your courage and jump off the ledge.  You fall and fall, but
fortunately, the shuttle has moved directly under you!  You land on the floor
of the shuttle undamaged.

Central Hub, in the shuttle
   This is the central hub of the shuttle system, a huge cavernous area that
allows shuttles from one depot to reach any other depot.  The four walls are
lined with tunnels; each wall is a three-by-three grid of tunnel entrances.

is heading toward the south wall's right bottom hole.

dropping out of the sky.  You look up to see a huge black spherical object
plummeting from the southwest.  The brown spiny-beaked pin-headed swamp weasel
yelps and leaps to the northeast; a few moments later, the black spherical
object lands in the open jaws of a huge plant in front of you with a "fwoop".

   The plant is struggling to hold a brown spiny-beaked pin-headed swamp weasel
in its open jaws.  The brown spiny-beaked pin-headed swamp weasel looks almost
comical in its horror at becoming plant food.  It looks at you longingly, as
though asking you to help it out of its predicament, and as though it has
forgotten that not too long ago you were to be its meal.

The plant does its usual ejection bit, sending a confused and terrified brown
spiny-beaked pin-headed swamp weasel arcing high overhead to the east.  Moments
later, it lands, and quickly regains its senses.  Seeing the impressive saber-
toothed triple-ringed xeno-beaver, the swamp weasel turns to run.  But the
saber-toothed triple-ringed xeno-beaver won't let it get away!  The saber-
toothed triple-ringed xeno-beaver chases the swamp weasel past you into the
swamp; they disappear into the distance.

squeeze the trigger, an enormous xeno-beaver comes up behind him and, seeing
the entrance to its nest blocked, starts to attack.  Pinback shouts in terror,
and runs off into the swamp.

A previously unseen communications panel attracts your attention.  "Attention,
unidentified ship," a voice says through a speaker, "are you in need of
assistance?"
   You find the transmitter, and explain your situation.  You quickly learn
that the calling ship is a Galactic Spaceway Patrol cruiser that was in the
area responding to someone else's distress signal.
   The cruiser takes you on board.  As you're departing your small shuttle, the
commander comes over to you.  You cheerfully greet him, thinking he has come to
congratulate you for shutting down the dangerous laser base.  "Do you know why
we pulled you over?"  he asks, then proceeds to request your pilot's license
and proof of insurance.  "You were operating an unspaceworthy vessel, young
man.  I'm afraid you'll have to come downtown with us."
   He escorts you to the ship's brig, where you are surprised to see Sigourney,
the woman who answered your distress signal.  She explains that she never made
it down to the planet, since her ship was disabled by a near miss from the
laser.  "So the GSP answered my distress signal and came and picked me up, and
then they gave me this!"  She shows you a citation for operating an
unspaceworthy vessel, just like the one you received.  "Oh, well, I suppose it
beats spinning uncontrollably through space until either your oxygen runs out
or you burn up entering the atmosphere of some anonymous planet."
   At that, the commander turns and walks away, laughing maniacally, as the
brig doors slam shut on another chapter in your life.

In a total of 397 turns, you have achieved a score of 200 points out of a
possible 200.
Thanks for playing Deep Space Drifter!
