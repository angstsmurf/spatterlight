Name
  h_ix86_64.h - hardware definitions for x86-64 (64-bit x86) platforms
Function
  These definitions are designed ONLY for 64-bit x86 CPUs.  Note that these
  probably will NOT work on 16- and 32-bit x86 hardware.
Notes
  IMPORTANT!  See the note below about the typedef for hix_int32.

/* 
 *   Define local covers for the 32-bit and 16-bit integer types.
 *   
 *   For some of our operations, we need to translate between the local
 *   native types and the portable types.  The portable types are explicitly
 *   defined with exact byte sizes and byte orderings.  One way to do these
 *   translations is to read and write the portable values one byte at a
 *   time, and do some arithmetic to carry out the translation to the native
 *   types.  However, there's a more efficient approach: x86 CPUs happen to
 *   have native types that match our portable types in size and byte order,
 *   so the efficient way to do the translations is simply to use the correct
 *   native type that corresponds to each portable type.
 *   
 *   That's the purpose of these definitions - since the portable types are
 *   of specific sizes, we need to map the native type that exactly matches
 *   each portable type.
 *   
 *   This is complicated by a *second* level of mapping, which is from C
 *   types (short, int, long) to native types (WORD, DWORD, QWORD): this
 *   mapping can vary by compiler.
 *   
 *   So, our typedefs here are designed to give us the correct mapping from C
 *   types to portable types, by taking into account the way our compiler
 *   maps from C to native.
