The TADS 2 Unix source distribution is now separate from this generic
distribution.  You should look at the site where you found this zip file
and look for another file with a name like this:

  tads23-unix.tar.gz

That file should contain the latest source distribution packaged for easy
Unix installation.

Please see http://www.tads.org if you need to contact anyone for more
help.
