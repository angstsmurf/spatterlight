To run the tests, first do a "make all tests" from the unix/ directory. If
all goes well, type "make install" (the library files must be installed
before the tests can run successfully). Then enter unix/test (this directory)
and type "run_all_tests".

Test output will be placed in the test/out directory. You should check
up on any .diff files which are placed there; they indicate a mismatch
between the test log and the pre-generated log.
