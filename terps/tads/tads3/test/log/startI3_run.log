Welcome to the TADS 3 Starter Game!

Entryway
This large, formal entryway is slightly intimidating: the walls are lined with
somber portraits of gray-haired men from decades past; a medieval suit of
armor, posed with a battle axe at the ready, towers over a single straight-
backed wooden chair.  The front door leads back outside to the south.  A
hallway leads north.

Kitchen
This is a surprisingly cramped kitchen, equipped with antique accoutrements:
the stove is a huge black iron contraption, and in place of a refrigerator is
an actual icebox.  A hallway lies to the south.

>look in stove
(first opening the stove)
The stove contains a loaf of bread.

>save "saveI3.t3v"
Saved.

>get bread and eat it
Taken.

You tear off a piece and eat it; it's delicious.  You tear off a little more,
then a little more, and before long the whole loaf is gone.

>look in icebox
(first opening the icebox)
You see nothing unusual in the icebox.

It's been a long time since any ice was in there.

>restart
Do you really want to start over? (Y is affirmative) > yes
