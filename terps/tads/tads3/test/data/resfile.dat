This is a data file for the 'resfile.t' test.

IMPORTANT NOTE - this file does NOT have the same name as the
resource that the file loads, because we explicitly set a
different resource name when we run the resource bundler in
the test script.  That's the whole point of the test, really -
we want to make sure that we properly load the data from the
resource embedded in the image file, not from an external OS
file.

This is just some random data for the test.  There's no real
significance to the data; we just want to make sure that the
program can read the data and display it.

We'll copy in the text of the resource program itself, to give
some volume to the data (to ensure we exercise buffer filling
and so on in the file reader layers).

    #charset "us-ascii"

    #include <tads.h>
    #include <file.h>

    main(args)
    {
        local f;

        /* read a resource file */
        f = File.openTextResource('testres.txt', 'iso-8859-1');

        /* read from the file until done */
        for (local linenum = 1 ; ; ++linenum)
        {
            local txt;

            /* read another line - stop at eof */
            if ((txt = f.readFile()) == nil)
                break;

            /* show it */
            "<<linenum>>:<<txt>>";
        }

        "\<\<EOF>>\b";
    }

That's about it for this file.
