Name
  tcsrc.h - TADS3 compiler source file reader
Function
  Provides I/O on source files, translating character sets between
  the file's character set and the internal UTF8 representation.

  A source file's character set is determined as follows:

  - If the first two bytes of the file are 0xFF, 0xFE, the file is taken
  as Unicode UCS-2 encoding, 16 bits per character, with low-order bytes
  stored first in each byte pair making up a character.  (The special
  Unicode marker character is 0xFEFF, and the character 0xFFFE is
  specifically illegal.  So, if we see FF FE in that order, we know that
  it must be taken to mean 0xFEFF, hence high byte second, because the
  other possibility - high byte first - would yield an invalid character.)

  - If the first two bytes of the file are 0xFE, 0xFF, the file is taken
  as Unicode UCS-2 encoding, 16 bits per character, with high-order bytes
  stored first.

  - If the first nine bytes of the contain the ASCII string "#charset"
  followed by an ASCII 0x20 byte, we obtain the name of the character
  set stored in the file by skipping past any following 0x20 or 0x09
  bytes.  The next character must be a double quote (0x22) character.
  We will scan characters up to the next double quote (0x22) character,
  which must occur within 256 bytes or before any CR or LF (0x0D, 0x0A)
  characters.  The characters between the quotes will be taken as the
  character set name.

  - If none of the above information is found at the beginning of the
  file, we take the file to be in the current global default character
  set.
