<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">GiveToAskFor provides, in a somewhat limited way, the means to translate commands like:
<br>

<br>
<b>&gt;bob, give me the gold
<br>
</b>
<br>
into
<br>

<br>
<b>&gt;ask bob for the gold
<br>
</b>
<br>
It does this by defining a StringPreparser that simply looks for input of the form "X, GIVE ME Y" and transforms it into "ASK X FOR Y". This may  have odd effects if Y is not simply the name of an object or topic that can occur in an ASK FOR command. For example, if the player typed:
<br>

<br>
<b>&gt;bob, give me the coin, then go north</b>
<br>

<br>
The input would be translated into
<br>

<br>
<b>&gt;ask bob for the coin, then go north
<br>

<br>
</b>Which would not mean the same thing. The moral is that the mechanism this module employs is somewhat fragile, and should be used only at your risk.<b>
<br>

<br>
To use GiveToAskFor simply include GiveToAskFor.t in the list of source files in your project makefile.
