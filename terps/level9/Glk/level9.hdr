# IFP header definitions for Level 9
#
# The two main Level 9 formats are Spectrum snapshots (.sna), and Level 9
# data files (.dat).  Neither format has a magic identifier in them, so
# the following is based on observations only, and may be insufficient, or
# just plain wrong.
#
# For .sna snapshot files containing Level 9 games V2 and above, the same
# four bytes appear at offset 1 in the file : "58 27 9B 36".  For what it's
# worth, these represent the values of the registers HL', and DE', I think.
# By the way, this pattern excludes the known V1 game, which the inter-
# preter cannot play.
#
# For .dat data files, the only commonality seems to be "00" at offset 13,
# and "00 00 00" at offset 19.  This is not at all safe; for example, tar
# archives match this pattern too.  So for now, this header file will not
# recognize .dat data files.  You can, however, turn them into pseudo-
# snapshots with
#
#    ( echo -e "\000\130\047\233\066\c"; cat somefile.dat ) >somefile.lev
#
# This doesn't make the file a .sna snapshot, but it does put enough of a
# marker on it that the Level 9 plugin will find it, and since the interp-
# reter searches in the file for the game data, it'll work.  Because this
# is cryptic, I'll add a secondary header to look for - "LVL9" at the very
# start of the file.  You can add this to a .dat data file with the marg-
# inally less confusing
#
#    ( echo "LVL9"; cat somefile.dat ) >somefile.lev
#
# For now, this is, unfortunately, the best workround available.

IFP_ENGINE_DESCRIPTION=\
"This is an interpreter for Level 9 games in any format, including
 Spectrum snapshots (.sna files), and is capable of playing V2, V3,
 and V4 Level 9 games.  Currently, the interpreter plugin recognizes
 only snapshot files.  Other files need to be specially marked with
 'LVL9' in the first four bytes.\n"
