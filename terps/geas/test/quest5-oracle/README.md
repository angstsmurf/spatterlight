# Quest 5 ground-truth oracle (`qvh`)

A headless driver for **QuestViva** — the cross-platform .NET port of the Quest 5
engine (`github.com/textadventures/quest`, branch `main`, aka "Quest Viva"). It
loads a real `.quest`/`.aslx` game, replays a command script, and prints a
normalised plain-text transcript.

This is the reference oracle for the planned native Geas ASLX engine
(`terps/geas/TODO-quest5.md`, milestone 6): once that engine exists, diff its
transcript for a given command script against `qvh`'s, exactly as
`test/a5_groundtruth.sh` diffs Scarier against FrankenDrift. Until then it also
serves to capture golden transcripts and to answer "what does real Quest do
here?" questions during the port.

The QuestViva checkout lives **outside** this repo (it is ~42 MB and MIT-licensed
but not something to vendor), just like the FrankenDrift build the a5 oracle uses.

## Requirements

- .NET 9 SDK (`brew install dotnet` — this Mac has 9.0.100, arm64).
- Network access on first build (to clone QuestViva).

## Build

```sh
./build.sh
```

Clones QuestViva into `$ORACLE_HOME` (default `~/questviva-oracle`), applies the
deterministic-RNG patch (below), and builds `bin/Release/net10.0/qvh.dll`. With
the .NET 10 SDK the checkout needs no retargeting. Override the location with
`ORACLE_HOME=/path ./build.sh`.

## Run one game

```sh
dotnet bin/Release/net9.0/qvh.dll <game.quest|game.aslx> [command-script.txt]
```

Transcript → stdout, diagnostics (`[diag] …`) → stderr. With no script it just
prints the opening turn.

### Command-script format

Mirrors QuestViva's own `WalkthroughRunner` step format, so a game's built-in
`<walkthrough>` steps and hand-written scripts drive identically:

| line | effect |
|---|---|
| plain line | `SendCommand` (also answers a pending `get input`) |
| `menu:KEY` | answer a `show menu` (`KEY` is an option key) |
| `answer:yes` / `answer:no` | answer an `ask` |
| `assert:EXPR` | evaluate `EXPR`, record `[assert PASS/FAIL]` in the transcript |
| `label:…`, `delay:N`, `runtime:` | ignored (editor bookkeeping) |
| `event:NAME;PARAM` | `SendEvent` |
| `# …` | comment |

`wait` and `DoPause` ("press any key") prompts are auto-continued and consume no
script line. For human-authored walkthroughs that lack the `menu:`/`answer:`
prefixes, a bare line pending a menu/question is resolved leniently (menu key,
option number, or yes/no).

## Corpus regression

`extract_welbourn.py` converts a David Welbourn (Key & Compass) walkthrough
`.txt` — where commands are `> `-prefixed and packed several-per-line with `. `
separators — into a flat one-command-per-line script.

Note: `game.multiplecommands` defaults to **false** in Core and most games leave
it off, so the engine will *not* split a `.`-joined line itself — pre-splitting
here is required, and also yields one deterministic turn per command.

`run_corpus.sh` runs every `~/Downloads/Quest 5 games/*.quest` that has a
matching `~/Downloads/Quest 5 walkthroughs/<Game> - walkthrough.txt`, writing
`out/<Game>.out` transcripts and printing a coverage table (ASL version, steps,
emits, final state). See the [[quest5-corpus]] memory for the corpus itself.

## Two gotchas the harness handles

1. `Begin()` is fire-and-forget internally, but returns a task that completes
   when the turn **suspends** — await it (and `SendCommand`) rather than polling
   for output to go quiet.
2. Quest 5 (ASL ≥ v540) delivers game text as JS calls: `JS.addText(html)`
   arrives as `IPlayer.RunScriptAsync("addText", [html])`, *not* through
   `PrintText`. The harness captures both channels (legacy path for ASL < v540).

## Determinism (RNG)

The oracle replaces QuestViva's `Random` with `ErkyrathRandom` — a C# port of
Spatterlight's `erkyrath_random()` (`terps/common_utils/randomness.c`): xoshiro128**
seeded via SplitMix32, verified byte-identical to the C generator. `build.sh`
injects it via `patch_questviva.py` (idempotent; touches only the three RNG lines
in `ExpressionOwner.cs` plus a new `ErkyrathRandom.cs`), so the clone stays
otherwise pristine.

Seed defaults to **1234** (Spatterlight determinism convention); override with
`QVH_SEED=<n>`. `GetRandomInt(min,max)` uses the inclusive-range mapping from
`terps/scarier/a5rand.cpp` (`span = max-min+1; min + rand % span`); the native
Geas engine **must replicate this** for its transcripts to match the oracle.
Result: games using `GetRandomInt`/`GetRandomDouble` now produce identical
transcripts across runs.

## Known gaps

- Non-Welbourn walkthrough formats (e.g. *I Contain Multitudes*, *Night House*)
  aren't extracted by `extract_welbourn.py`; their command lists live elsewhere
  in the document.
